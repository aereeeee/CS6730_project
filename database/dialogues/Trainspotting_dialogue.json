Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road. He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives approaching. Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits. Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud. The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.",
