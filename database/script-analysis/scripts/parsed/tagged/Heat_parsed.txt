S: EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY
N: A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant. Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough. At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds flat. ANGLE Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white intern's coat from his paper bag.

S: INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY
N: We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by. A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages. PROFILE Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going towards the exit doors. TRAVELING - FRONTAL Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and pass by Neil.
T: CUT TO:
N: WIDE REAR SHOT Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe he's stolen it. We don't know.

S: EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY
N: CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red, Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves. He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made. Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to 1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

S: INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY
N: MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house. He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you were talking about. CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED CLERK.

E: starting out of bed
C: HANNA
D: I'm out of time...
N: He leaves.
C: JUSTINE
D: Falls back on the pillow, disappointed. It's as if she'd been stood-up. The bed sheet falls half off of her. She's exposed, vulnerable. She looks out the window, occluded by light muslin, away from us and exhales.

Cerrito has the monster mask three eyes and a twisted mouth. Waingro is a beautiful woman. Their movements now are very fast. Cerrito pulls the truck out of the alley. CERRITO'S POV: As we approach the street an armored truck passes by. We fall in behind. At this point we realize these men are going to pull down an armed robbery of this armored truck.

Once it escalated into a Murder One beef for all of them after they killed the first two, they popped guard number three 'cause it didn't rake any difference anymore, so why leave a living witness? Drop of a hat? They'll rock and roll. Also: the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl. So also start looking for recent highline burgularies that have 'mystified' us. Run the "slick" bit to the FBI and see what it kicks out.

How'd they know the route of the van and what it was carrying? Does Gage print the day's routes? What do they do with the printouts? Who collects their trash? Run makes on all their middlemanagement.

N: HANNA runs across the grass between the fence to the strobe lights. CLOSER: HANNA among the structures housing the ballasts for the lights. The ROAR of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him. He spins to protect his face. His clothes and hair are whipped. As he runs to us ... CLOSER: HANNA looks up.. HANNA POV: UP INTO LIGHTS SEARCHING FOR NEIL. SUDDENLY: NEIL (SLO MO) is there. His .45 is up, centered into Hanna's face. He's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of strobes. NEIL'S HAND (SLO MO) squeezing the trigger, both eyes over the front sight, moving laterally on target through the liquid air and lights... NEIL'S .45 (SLO MO) as the trigger's squeezed and the sear's released and... MACRO: THE .45's HAMMER (SLO MO) falling. HANNA (SLO MO) coming up with his 9mn. He's too late... NEIL The hammer drops.

MACRO: THE BREECH OF NEIL'S .45 (SLO MO) The misfired round, ejected and spinning away. The new round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery... HANNA FIRES THREE perfectly controlled, hammered-on SHOTS. His front sight barely moved. NEIL HIT THREE TIMES in the chest - is blown back into the racks of lights. He lies still. HANNA approaches, slowly. His gun hand drops to his side. WIDE: NEIL + HANNA Neil's on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm is in his lap. The other is flung over the top bar of the strobe rack. Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his hand. Hanna takes it. Neil holds on tight. NEIL last breath.
C: NEIL
D: ...not half bad.
C: HANNA
D: ...pretty good your own self.
N: Then Neil's eyes dim. And he dies. LONG REAR SHOT: HANNA + NEIL Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of them stay there like that. THE END
