S: INT. HOUSE - CLOSED EYES
N: A young man's blue eyes slowly open. A girl moans from the next room.
S: EXT. STREET CORNER - A LARGE TIRE
N: turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside.
S: INT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE EYES
N: They snap wide as the young woman in the next room MOANS even louder.
S: EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A WET NIGHT
N: A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD BRONCO rests in the driveway.
S: EXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM
N: TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car. They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the car, another man methodically waits.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES
N: The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads 3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side. A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall. Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner. The off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's attention. He sits up and looks through the blinds.

S: INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

D: Holy shit.
N: Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door.
S: INT. DEREK'S BEDROOM - A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG
N: It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant, tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach orgasm. TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head, a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade. Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.
C: DANNY
E: softly
N: Der ! Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.
C: DEREK
E: controlled
N: What? Stacey stops and looks over. Frustated, she rolls off Derek and onto her side.
C: STACEY
D: Fucking pervert, Dan!
C: DANNY
D: There's a black guy outside Der... breaking into your car.
N: Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and shoves in a clip.
C: DEREK
D: How long has he been out there?
C: DANNY
D: Not long.
N: STACEY Who?
C: DEREK
D: Nobody. Relax.
N: Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his black combat boots.
C: STACEY
D: Who's out there, Derek?
C: DEREK
D: Not right now, honey. How many?
E: to Danny
C: DANNY
D: One...I think.
C: DEREK

C: DANNY
D: Hunh?
C: DEREK
D: Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?
C: DANNY
D: I'm not sure.
C: DEREK
D: Is there a driver?
N: Danny nods his head yes.
C: DEREK
D: Okay. Stay the luck here.
C: STACEY
D: Derek? Be careful.
N: He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.
S: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
N: TIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity on his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and grabs the doorknob. Before he turns the knob, he peeks through the eye hole on the door.
S: EXT. HOUSE - DEREK'S EYE POV
N: THE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.
S: INT. HOUSE - DEREK AT THE DOOR
N: The guard has his back to him. Derek goes.
S: EXT. HOUSE - THE DUEL
N: Derek throws open the door and the black man standing guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door. Derek buries two bullets in his chest.
C: DEREK
D: Fuck you!
N: The force propels the man six feet backwards.
S: INT./EXT. BRONCO - THE OTHER MAN
N: Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot after shot at it until it disappears.
S: INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS
N: Davina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they were in Vietnam. They meet in the hallway, still not able to place the direction of the gunfire. DAVINA MOM!!!!
C: DORIS
D: STAY DOWN, HONEY! DANNY?!
N: They stay down on the carpet together.
S: EXT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S POV
N: From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his wounded prey - crawling on the ground. Sirens sound from a distance.
C: STACEY
D: Get down, Danny! Jesus!
E: O.S.
N: TIGHT ON DANNY. His gaze is locked on his brother from his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and walks toward the man. TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
N: THREE YEARS LATER
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING
N: A black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes through the automatic doors and into the station. He approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.
C: SWEENEY
D: Captain Rasmussen?
C: DESK SERGEANT
D: Briefing room. Down that hall...third door on the left.
S: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING
N: Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee. The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly reaches for a file.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: All right. Moving on-- Good Morning, Doctor.
E: acknowledging
N: The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.
C: SWEENEY
D: Good morning.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney. He's Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he's done a load of outreach work with gangs...in and out of the can.
N: Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough. He sips water and continues.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Three years ago a local kid named Derek Vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of Crips who were trying to jack his car. Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and has followed the case closely.
C: YOUNG COP
D: He was a skinhead, right?
C: SWEENEY
D: Derek was more like...the skinhead. He and Cameron Alexander.
N: COP #2 Who? Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Cammeron Alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in LA County. He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe age of forty.
C: YOUNG COP
D: He's forty? Jesus.
E: smiling
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Pretty clean record...runs everything out of his house down by the beach.
C: SWEENEY
D: There weren't any organized white gangs around Venice before those two hooked up. Very few, if any. It was mostly just black and Mexican. But it was tiny. They hit it off though... and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek.
N: Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: We got some uncut footage here. Courtesy of NBC.
N: ON THE TELEVISION--
C: REPORTER
D: Earlier this evening...LA County Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected Compton drug den.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: This being February of '90.
E: to the group
S: EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE
N: A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck, he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.
C: REPORTER
D: To my right I have Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek. How do you feel about all this, son?
E: to Derek
C: DEREK
D: How do I feel? How do you think I feel? It's typical.
C: REPORTER
D: Typical how, Derek?
C: DEREK
D: Well...look at our country. It's a haven for criminals. Black...brown... yellow...whatever.
C: REPORTER
D: So you're saying the murder of your father is "race" related?
C: DEREK
D: Every problem in this country is "race" related. Every problem, not just crime. These problems are rooted in the black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian...every non- Protestant group in our society. Look at the shit. Immigration... welfare...AIDS...they're all the problems of the non-white. Look at the statistics.
E: then
C: REPORTER
D: Most of these issues you're referring to though son are related to--
C: DEREK
D: No no no! Don't say poverty right now cause that's not it. They're not a product of our fucking environment either! Minorities don't give two shits about this country! They're here to exploit...not embrace.
E: interrupting
C: RASMUSSEN
D: When Alexander got his hands on this segment...he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address for hate groups across the country.
E: O.S over reporter's question
N: BACK TO THE TELEVISION.
C: DEREK
D: Millions of white Europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation! A generation! So what the fuck is wrong with these people?!
C: REPORTER
D: What does any of this have to do with your father?
C: DEREK
D: Because my father was doing his fucking job! Saving a nigger neighborhood he didn't give two shits about! And he got killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare check.
N: Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to the reporter who just stands there, speechless.
S: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME
N: Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and he turns it off.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Vinyard was quietly released from Chino on Saturday after three and some odd years. And I think it's something we might want to keep an eye on for a few days.
C: SWEENEY
D: I don't wanna be an alarmist. But payback is out there. I know it is. And in this particular case...if Vinyard gets popped...more people will get popped.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: It's not exactly LAPD policy but I want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard for a few days.
N: COP #2 (smiling in disbelief) Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Just for a few days.
C: ANOTHER COP
D: He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here, Captain. You want us to bust him or protect him?
N: Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.
C: SWEENEY
D: I don't think Vinyard's gonna be the one to start anything. It's his following.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Either way...let's keep it low.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNING
N: PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles north to get a better break on the next set. Danny watches as he skateboards down the strand. His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger, softer Derek. Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M., and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - A URINAL
N: Danny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny zips up and faces them.
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: Tellin' Baker I'm fuckin' cheatin'? I've never cheated in my life.
E: to a terrified Daryl
N: BUDDY #1 Beat his ass, Henry!
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: Why you trippin' on me?
C: DARYL
D: I didn't say anything, Henry. I swear.
N: BUDDY #2 He's lying, man! I was right there! Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.

N: The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to Danny.

D: I do not have a problem with him as an individual, alright!?
E: O.S.
C: SWEENEY
D: Oh shit Murray sure you do. You hate this kid.
E: O.S.
S: INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION
N: The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48, looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY, who now has his jacket off. He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF. "Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left hand corner.
C: MURRAY
D: This paper is a travesty, Bob! Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero?! You've gotta draw a line.
C: SWEENEY
D: Murray...it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil Rights.
C: MURRAY
D: Oh come on, Bob!
C: SWEENEY
D: Let me finish! He needs help...I'm not disputing that. But I read it and I'm not going to throw him out.
C: MURRAY
D: His brother probably put him up to it.
C: SWEENEY
D: I can guarantee you his brother didn't have anything to do with it, Murray.
N: Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.
C: MURRAY
D: Don't let him walk scot-free here. For his sake...not mine. You might be all he has left.

N: Before he even gets through the door he's chastised.
C: SWEENEY
D: What's it gonna be, Dan?
C: DANNY
D: What's what going to be?
C: SWEENEY
D: This petty shit you're pullin'.
C: DANNY
D: Well...I don't know.
C: SWEENEY
D: You said it, all right. Sit down.
N: Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair.
C: SWEENEY
D: Are you okay?
C: DANNY
D: Yeah.
C: SWEENEY
D: Any time you wanna talk, Dan--
C: DANNY
D: Okay.
C: SWEENEY

D: Fine.
C: SWEENEY
D: Adjusting okay?
C: DANNY
D: Yeah.
C: SWEENEY
D: He was a student of mine. Honors English. He was a great student... like you...but he hung out with scumbags. Also like you. That's why he ended up in the pen, hunh?
N: No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.
C: SWEENEY
D: Great writing. I can't correct it though. It wreaks too much of shit.
C: DANNY
D: Come on, man! I followed directions and wrote an "A" paper. It's got nothing to do with Derek.
C: SWEENEY
D: Everything you do now has something to do with Derek. Who told you to do this?
C: DANNY
D: Let us get on with our lives, man!
C: SWEENEY
D: Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he can take care of himself. I'm worried about his little brother. Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!
E: softly
C: DANNY
D: Do it. What? You don't think I could handle it?
C: SWEENEY
D: The street would kill you, Danny. You're not tough. The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll be holierin' for Doris. So here's the drill. Take it or leave it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm your history teacher from here on out. We're gonna deal with shit happening right now. Call it American History...X. I see your ass once a day. Any more, any less, and you're a memory at Venice High. Clear?
E: smiling in disbelief pondering to himself
C: DANNY
D: It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. Come on, Sweeney.
C: SWEENEY
D: My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a another paper on my desk tomorrow.
C: DANNY
D: What am I doing it on then?

N: SMASH TO:
S: EXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON

A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and boxers. TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk, performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit, recovers, and looks off into the distance.
C: DANNY
D: People look at me...and they see my brother. That's how things have gone since the murder of our father.
E: V/O
S: EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT
N: From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold glance.

D: Little Henry Hastings and his older brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline Crip...Henry's on his way.
E: V/O
N: Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.
C: DANNY
D: Venice Beach, man. It didn't always look like this. I mean...our Dad used to take us down here to run...and it was cool. Derek fucking owned this place. Since then though...the gangs, man--
E: V/O
N: TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.
C: DANNY
D: --they've moved west from Inglewood and South Central and have really just...taken over. Especially at my high school. The Venice Locos are big too but they hang out in bumluck Mar Vista. It's scary. And then there's The Disciples of Christ. The D.O.C.
E: V/O then
N: Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra players and spectators.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK
N: DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3 blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1 Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better, predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed on his head. JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON. Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on the bleachers.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Seven-six. Let's go! Set some picks!
C: SETH
D: Bring it on, boy.
N: Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Boy?
N: Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.
C: SETH
D: Lucky piece of shit! I'm through "monkeying" around with your ass!
N: Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating, cracker, motherfucker. A hundred bucks says I make you my bitch.
C: SETH
D: Here we go! Trying to make ends meet for that cut in welfare.
E: to the crowd
N: He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline. Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks at him, concerned.
C: DANNY
D: It's eight-six, Seth.
C: SETH
D: When I want your fucking opinion I'll ask for it, fuckhead. Help me cover here, guys.
E: to Derek and Cam
N: Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose and embarrass them.
C: CAMMERON
D: You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.
C: SETH
D: I'll take this negro down.
C: DEREK
D: You can't take a shit, Seth. Shut up.
N: Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and stands. He shouts for all to hear.
C: DEREK
D: I got a bet.
N: Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.
C: DEREK
D: I come in, same score now, first one to eleven. Black boys against the white boys.
N: Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Name your price, Cracker.
C: DEREK
D: No money...for the court. We win, you grab your shit and find a different place to run. Not just today... forever. You win, and we don't come back. No hitching, no fighting, here in front of everyone. Six-eight, our ball.
N: The action around the court gets very still. Finally, Lawrence nods.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You got a lot of fucking balls, man. Bring it. Right now.
N: Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey. Lawrence gets his team together.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE
N: No more mixed assemblage of players. One team is white, one team is black. A SERIES OF SMOTS Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.
C: SETH
D: Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
N: SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches intently.
C: CAMMERON
D: It's all you, Der!
C: LAWRENCE
D: Fuckin' BYU, man! All right! All we need is one now!
N: Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.
C: CAMMERON
D: Use that fat ass and keep him out, Seth!
N: Seth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I ain't losin' in my house! Clear it out!
N: The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court -- his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face, sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.
C: CURTIS
D: That's fuckin' offense!
C: LAWRENCE
D: Get the fuck outta here! He was movin' his feet!
N: Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.
C: DEREK
D: I'll go if you want to.
E: threateningly
C: LAWRENCE
D: You wanna piece! Bring it!
N: Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the teams hate each other.
C: DEREK
D: If you wanna go...I'm ready. Don't be throwin' fuckin' elbows.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Fuck you!
N: Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip. Cameron stares at Derek.
C: CAMMERON
D: Hey. Are you copacetic?
N: Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.
C: CAMMERON
D: He's gonna do that 180 spin move.
C: DEREK
D: I know what he's gonna do.
C: DANNY
D: You gotta call offense on that shit.
C: DEREK
D: Not on point game you don't.
C: STACEY
D: Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull that shit. It's fucking-
C: DEREK
D: Not on point, honey.
N: He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence. He stands in front of him and checks the ball in. DEREK Tens! Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT. Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off the fast break and DUNKS IT.
C: DANNY
D: Holy shit!
E: amazed by the dunk
N: Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered. Everyone is riveted on Derek.
C: SETH
D: Get off my fucking court! This is my house!
E: to the other team
C: DANNY
D: Yeah! Fuck...yeah!
N: A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his bitter opponent, and says nothing.
T: CUT TO:

N: Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off. DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear, and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER. Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill. Derek meets their gaze.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - PRESENT - DANNY'S POV
N: Danny awakens from his daydream. The black players now stare at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down the boardwalk.
C: DANNY

C: DEREK
D: All right. Thanks. I'll take care of it. Yeah.
N: DANNY'S POV. He opens the door and sees Derek on the phone with his back to him. Above Derek is Danny's surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling. Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet. The sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back (D.O.C.) define the hatred that has engulfed his past.
C: DEREK
D: Okay. Okay. I'm what? What channel?

NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table. TIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story. Random black protestors nod and comment in the background.

C: SETH
D: What do you hate, Danny?
C: DANNY
D: I hate everyone that isn't white Protestant.
C: SETH
D: Why? And say it with some fucking conviction!
C: DANNY
D: Because they're a burden to the advancement of the white race. Some of them are all right--
C: SETH
D: None of them are all right, Danny. They're all a bunch of fucking freeloaders. Remermber Canuneron. "We don't know them, we don't want to know them, they're the fucking enemy." What don't you like about them?
E: after a beat
C: DANNY

D: I feel.sorry for you, Danny.
C: SETH
D: Shut up, Davina.
C: DAVINA
D: You shut up, you poison to fuckin' society! Get out of our house!
C: SETH
D: Is this any way to treat a guest?
E: laughing
C: DAVINA
D: Derek hates you, Seth.
C: DEREK
D: How do you know who I hate, Davina?
E: O.S.
N: TIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE. He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps around his waist.
C: DAVINA
D: What do you mean?
E: O.S
N: Seth stands and smiles.
C: SETH
D: Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A. Long time no see. Look at that hair.
N: Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a reluctant hand instead.

D: Gimme just one second, okay?
N: Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny.
C: DEREK
D: Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf?
C: DANNY

D: That figures. You're more stupid than he is.
C: SETH
D: It's nice to see you too, man.
C: DEREK
D: Why'd you do it, Dan? Because of Seth.
C: DANNY
D: No.
C: DEREK
D: Cammeron?
C: DANNY
D: I did it cause I felt like it.
C: DEREK
D: Oh, you do everything you feel like? I feel like smacking you in the fucking head. Would you mind if I did a report on that?
C: DANNY
D: Uhhh...yeah.
C: DEREK
D: Get a clue, you dumbshit. Hey! Look at me! Don't be a dickhead. Sweeney cares about you.
C: SETH
D: Sweeney does? Since when?
E: smiling
C: DANNY
D: Was that him on the phone?
C: DEREK
D: Yep. So wise up. You hear me?
C: SETH
D: Sweeney's a fuckin' nigger on a power trip, Vinyard. That's what he was like when we were there and that's how he is now. It'll never change either. A nigger is a nigger.
N: Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him. Suddenly, Doris starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK. Derek quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - THE PINK BLANKET
N: She coughs incessantly. Derek sits down beside her, hands her the water, and caresses her head. The others stare at her in the background.
C: DORIS
D: Just put me out of my mercy.
C: DEREK
D: You'll be okay. You want me to pick you up any more medicine?
N: Together they look at all the bottles and laugh. Derek checks out the couch.

D: Are you gonna to live or what, Mom?
C: DORIS
D: I need a cigarette.
C: DEREK
D: My ass. You smoke two packs a day. That's why you're spittin' phlegm.
N: Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin.
C: SETH
D: Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard. I think a lung just came up.
E: astonished
N: Everybody laughs -- including Doris. Derek tenderly puts his hand on his mother's cheek.
C: DORIS
D: I'm high as a kite.
C: DANNY
D: You got any more?
C: DORIS
D: Daniel? I know you got homework.
C: DANNY
D: I'm goin' in a second. Relax.
C: SETH
D: Hey. I'm gonna re-wipe and we're out of here.
E: interjecting to Derek
N: Seth laughs as he walks down the hall.
C: DAVINA
D: You're a pig.
C: DORIS
D: I don't like him in this house.
C: DEREK
D: I knew.
C: DAVINA
D: He ' s a fuckin ' loser, Nazi scumbag.
C: DANNY
D: No he's not.
C: DEREK
D: Yes he is. Open your eyes.
N: Danny looks at Derek and smiles.
C: DANNY
D: Whatever, dude. I'm gonna go power that shit and I'll see you later.
N: He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.
C: DEREK
D: Not at Cammeron's you won't see me.
C: DANNY
D: Come on, Der! It's gonna be fuckin'--
E: turning back
C: DEREK
D: Forget it, Danny! It ain't gonna happen for you tonight.
N: Danny walks off, frustrated. He crosses Seth's path, gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an everyday occurrence. Seth moves out the side window and climbs out.
C: SETH
D: Hurry up. I'm starving.
C: DAVINA
D: What else is new?
N: Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the forehead.
C: DEREK
D: I'll see ya.
C: DORIS
D: Okay. Be careful.
N: DEREK I will. Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the alley.
S: INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS
N: She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.
S: EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK
N: Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted windows, it cruises past the apartment complex.
S: INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK
T: CUT TO:
N: Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework.

D: Come on! Dick Nixon's playin' at Cammeron's tonight. You owe me.
C: DAVINA
D: I'm not doing your homework for you! I gotta spreadsheet due!
C: DANNY
D: Goddammit!
N: Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.
C: DAVINA
D: What's the matter with you? You wanna be a fuckin' loser your whole life?
N: Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.
C: DANNY
D: Asshole Sweeney.
N: He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's the way things have gone since the murder of our father," TIGHT ON DANNY. The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself. himself.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
S: EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group of skins gathering.
C: DANNY
D: It was lunacy after he left us. All the time. Derek believed in Cammeron...he was angry...that combination gave them bodies. White punks...sick of gettin' their asses kicked by black and mexican gangs at school.
E: V/O
N: TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR. Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait. DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO. Stacey leans in from the backseat.

C: CAMMERON
D: He might have a gun.
C: DEREK
D: Are you going in or not?
C: CAMMERON
D: You know I got the cops on me. If I come up on one of those cameras I'm a dead man.
N: Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.
C: CAMMERON
D: Somebody needs to drive, Derek.
C: DEREK
D: All right. You can turn it off now. You're right on his tail, right?
E: referring to his mouth back to Stacey
C: STACEY
D: I hate that fucking Korean. I hope you smash his face in.
E: nodding

D: Just be ready, okay?
N: She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.
C: DEREK
D: Come on. Let's pull it together. Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games here. Let's go.
N: The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the ground.
C: DEREK
D: What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin' nigger now? Want some crack?
C: CURTIS
D: No.

D: Pull your fucking stupid head out of your ass then.
E: grabbing his neck
C: CURTIS
D: Okay. Jesus.
C: DEREK
D: We're here tonight cause we got immigration problems spiralling out of control. We got Asians up the ass... taking over our land with their fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into this place like some giant fucking Pinata was shattered.
E: to the group
N: The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.
C: DEREK
D: Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the Statue of Liberty it says "Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor, your huddled masses...yearning to be free." It does not say give me your shiftless, your greedy, your indolent, your criminals, looking for a free ticket.
N: The group agrees.
C: DEREK
D: We're here tonight to show the government how we feel about minorities taking over our country. The treat us like criminals while they reward them with jobs and fucking welfare checks. And it's only getting worse.
C: ET AL
D: Fuck yeah it is.
E: nodding
C: DEREK
D: Are you ready to do something about it?
C: ET AL
D: Yeah.
C: DEREK
D: Okay then.
N: AND THEY'RE MOVING. In formation. Fast. Directly at us. Angry. As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING MASK. He pulls it down over his face. The foot soldiers follow him in unison.
C: DEREK
D: Remember. No names. Danny? Stay right on my fucking ass, man.
E: back to his troops
N: And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.
S: EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME
N: They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth catches up to another and gets him on the ground.
C: SETH
D: Wheto's your fucking green card, asshole?
N: Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman alone like she's not even there and pushes over an adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF BEANS.
C: DEREK
D: Can't hide from me, motherfucker!
E: referring to the border
N: He kicks the man and looks around the market for more. Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a shelf of POTATO CHIPS. DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.
S: INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER
N: He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and-- FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like he's Superman. Derek looks to his watch and straightens up.
C: DEREK
D: Let's go! We're outta here! Move !
N: From just inside the door we see skins get in their last blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR;
S: INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY

E: V/O
S: INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM
N: Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard, shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away.
C: DANNY

E: V/O
N: TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos, loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall.
C: DANNY
D: Everyone but Derek.
E: V/O
C: DEREK
D: Fuck you, Murray. White men don't cruise the streets of LA killing each other.
C: MURRAY
D: No. You guys make bombs.
N: Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.
C: DEREK
D: You're so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant. White Americans don't take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over and trust the law.
E: then
C: MURRAY
D: You're kidding, right?
C: DAVINA
D: Don't you know, Murray? White people never break the law. We're perfect little angels.
E: sarcastically
C: DEREK
D: That's not what I said, Davina. Three different times Rodney King comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them. To hurt them! Three times! But since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape...the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once. All we see is Powell, Koon and Wind hittin' him and-- Briseno kickin' him in the back of the fuckin' skull with his boot. Still, the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and kick their asses! That's how stupid that motherfucker is. Those cops used textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were still here he'd say the same damn thing.
E: to the group busting up laughing
C: DORIS
D: That doesn't make it right.
C: DEREK
D: Yes it does. Yes it does. They're cops! They are taught to use that stick and they did.
C: MURRAY
D: Excessively.
C: DEREK
D: No. Appropriately. Appropriately! Cops have been granted a certain amount of authority by society and white people, unfortunately, are the only ones who acknowledge it. I acknowledge a cop's authority.
N: Davina starts to laugh.
C: DAVINA
D: Look who's talking about respecting the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.
C: DEREK
D: That's two errors in one sentence, Davina, so take a fucking course in semantics. First error--I didn't say I respect the law. I said I respect a cop's authority. Second error...I'm not a member of the fuckin' low rent, disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan.. Pull your head outta your ass and look at who you're dealing with.
C: MURRAY
D: Don't speak to her that way, Derek.
C: DEREK
D: Murray, stay out of it. You're not a member of this family and you never will be.
C: MURRAY
D: What the hell does that have to do with anything?
C: DORIS
D: You know...sometimes it's hard to believe I gave birth to you.
E: to Derek
C: DEREK
D: Give thanks to the food on the table and then believe it, Doris.
C: DORIS
D: We both put food on this table, fella.
C: DEREK
D: True enough. The point is...if Dan was walking across the street that night and Rodney King plowed into him--
C: DORIS
D: Can we forget about Rodney King for chrissake?!
C: DEREK
D: --while hopped up on Chivas and P.C.P...you'd consider the force those cops used to be justified!
E: fiercely continuing
C: DORIS
D: He didn't hit anybody!
C: DEREK
D: If he did though! If that shithead killed Dan...you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else. But since he didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across America" for the son of a bitch.
N: Derek takes a bite of food.
C: DEREK
D: We are still so hung up in this notion that we have an obligation to help the struggling black man and all you contribute to it! Lincoln freed the slaves a hundred and thirty years ago! Get off your fucking asses!
C: STACEY
D: I'm with you, honey. All the way. It's one...giant...ploy.
C: DAVINA
D: Here we go.
C: STACEY
D: I mean...nobody likes Chief whatever his name is, right?
C: DAVINA
D: Gates.
C: STACEY
D: Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted area where a video camera is sitting there...fucking waiting for him, man. What happens next? Chief Gates is dust. It's total--
N: Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.
C: DAVINA
D: May I be excused please?
E: to Doris
C: DEREK
D: Don't interrupt, Davina.
C: DAVINA
D: I didn't interrupt shit.
C: DEREK
D: The hell you didn't. I was listening to Stacey and then I heard you. That's called interrupting. Wait 'til she's finished and you can be excused.
C: DAVINA
D: Who the hell do you think you are?
N: Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back of the hair. The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe floor.
C: DEREK
D: You don't know when to shut up.
C: DORIS
D: Dammit Derek!
C: MURRAY
D: What are you trying to prove, man?!
N: Derek turns and laughs at Murray.
C: DEREK
D: I'm trying to teach my sister some respect, Murray.
C: DAVI NA
D: Let go of my fucking hair!
C: DEREK
D: See! See the way she speaks! Tell me you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.
E: to Murray
C: DORIS
D: Derek! Let go of her hair and sit down!
C: DEREK
D: I will when I hear an answer, Doris. Are you going to shut up, Davina?
N: TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing Danny's head. MURRAY Jesus!
C: DEREK
D: What are you thinkin'?
E: to Danny
C: DORIS
D: Danny?! Are you okay?!
N: Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.
C: DEREK
D: It's a real easy question, Davina. A simple yes or no will suffice. Tell me what I want to hear and I'll let go.
C: DAVINA
D: Fuck...you.
N: Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on the meat.
C: MURRAY
D: She can't breathe, Derek!
C: DEREK
D: Stay back, both of you! It's her bed, she's gotta lie in it. You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm not gonna let go until you tell me what I wanna hear! Are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of your's and let my girlfriend tell her opinion? Are you?!
E: grabbing harder
N: DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother. She grabs his arm though, forcefully.
C: DORIS
D: Let go of her hair and get out.
N: Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back bedroom crying, choking and coughing.
C: DAVINA
D: I hate you, you fucking asshole!
E: O.S
N: The door slams shut in the background. Doris, Murray, Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek. Derek calmly faces his brother.
C: DEREK
D: You okay?
N: Danny nods.
C: MURRAY
D: Psycho.
E: softly
N: IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT
N: He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at the past. BACK QUICKLY TO:
S: INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT.
N: Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.
C: DEREK
D: Would you care to repeat that, Murray? I'm not sure I got all of it.
C: STACEY
D: He called you a "psycho", honey.
E: smiling
C: DEREK
D: Was that it? Thanks Murray.
E: smiling back
C: MURRAY
D: See. Here we go again with this, Derek. Making me out to be the bad guy again.
C: STACEY
D: You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?
C: MURRAY
D: Hey goddammit! You talk to me with respect or--!
E: to Stacey
C: DEREK
D: Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna do? Give her fucking detention?
C: DORIS
D: Both of you get out right now.
N: Murray stares at Derek with pity. Doris becomes emotional.
C: DORIS
D: Do you think you're the only one who's affected around here?
E: to Derek
N: Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.
C: DEREK
D: Out of respect for my mother...I'm gonna let that comment go, Murray. I won't bash your face in. But let me tell you somethin'...man to fuckin' mouse here. Normally in a situation like this I'd take my steel-tips to your fucking Jewish temple. That goes for anyone making comments about me, my family, Stacey, whomever. You know and I know that I could crush that puny fuckin' skull of yours in a second. So it's beyond me why you would say something like that without being able to back it up? What's worse, you sack of shit, is you calling the woman I love a liar.
C: MURRAY
D: I never said she was a liar.
C: DEREK
D: Weasel like that again Murray...you fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating, teacher, faggot...and I'll cut your shylock nose off. Make no mistake.
N: Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila." Stacey joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.
C: STACEY
D: Murray Rosenberg...International Jew.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Murray goes to his car and Doris follows. Danny watches from the door.
C: DORIS
D: He's a stupid kid, Murray! I'm sorry!
C: MURRAY
D: He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids. We didn't call people kikes.
C: DORIS
D: It's just gonna take some time with him. What can I do?
C: MURRAY
D: You don't know your children, Doris! You have no clue about the world they live in. Your son is a terrorist.
C: DORIS
D: He's not a terrorist, Murray. Jesus!
C: MURRAY
D: He's a member of the Disciples of Christ. You remember that grocery store incident?!
N: DORIS Murray?
C: MURRAY
D: My sister and her two kids got evacuated from her Temple in Woodland Hills!
C: DORIS
D: Murray! Please! Derek would never have anything to do with bombs, okay?! You don't know him like I do.
C: MURRAY
D: And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.
N: Murray gets inside and goes down the street.
S: INT. HOUSE - SAME
N: DANNY'S POV -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in her hands, crying. BEHIND Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now wielding a BASEBALL BAT. DANNY Davina? Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye. He spots her at the last moment.
C: DAVINA
D: Take this, you fucking dick!
N: Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.
C: DEREK
D: Davina! It's okay! Calm down. Please.
C: DAVINA
D: Fuck you! Let go!
C: DEREK
D: I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.
E: whispering in her ear
C: DAVINA
D: Let go of me!
C: DEREK
D: Come on, Davina. I'm sorry. I lost control. Please. I screwed up.
N: Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down. He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over and over. Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around him. Derek looks to Danny.
C: DEREK
D: You guys are my life and I'd do anything for you. You do know that?
E: hugging Davina
C: DAVINA
D: I don't believe you anymore.
E: wiping her tears
C: DEREK
D: I swear to God I would, Davina. Please.
C: DANNY
D: I believe you, Der.
N: Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly.
C: DEREK
D: Davina? Please forgive me. Please. I'm sorry.
C: DAVINA
D: That fuckin' sucked, Derek.
E: nodding, after a beat
C: DEREK
D: I know it did. And I'm sorry. I just really hate that guy.
C: DAVINA
D: You couldn't tell.
N: A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door.
C: DORIS
D: Find an apartment because I want you out of here.
C: DEREK
D: Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's--
C: DORIS
D: I don't wanna hear it anymore! I want you out!
C: STACEY
D: He can move in with me.
C: DORIS
D: When?
C: STACEY
D: Tomorrow.
C: DORIS
D: Good.
N: She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT
N: He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down. From the other room, he hears Doris break into another coughing fit.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY
N: He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water.
C: DANNY
D: Here.
C: DORIS
D: Thank you, honey.
N: She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away.
C: DORIS
D: Hey. Come here. Sit with me.
C: DANNY
D: I've got this thing to do.
C: DORIS
D: You can sit down for two seconds.
N: He looks at her and sits beside her.
C: DANNY
D: Don't breathe on me.
C: DORIS
D: I won't.
N: They share a smile.
C: DANNY
D: It's cold in here, no wonder your sick.
N: She stares and smiles at him for a few moments.
C: DANNY
D: What?
C: DORIS
D: What? I'm not allowed to look at you anymore?
N: He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.
C: DANNY
D: No. You're not.
C: DORIS
D: Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back?
E: laughing
C: DANNY
D: Nope. Never.
C: DORIS
D: I bet you will.
N: He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room.
C: DANNY
D: Get some sleep.
C: DORIS
D: If you need me to proof anything for you I will.
C: DANNY
D: I'll be all right.
C: DORIS
D: Wake up early if you get tired.
N: Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant thoughts creeping back slowly.
S: INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNY
N: He grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent Skinhead Charged with Murder." The accompanying picture of Derek is near evil. TIGHT ON HIS EYES. Danny stares at the clipping. ON THE TRACK--GUNSHOTS.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM WINDOW - THE EYES - FLASHBACK
N: He watches Derek fire his gun at the TRANS AM as it blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded man on the lawn and points his weapon.
C: STACEY
D: Get on the floor, Danny! Jesus!
E: O.S.
N: Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room.
S: EXT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON DEREK
N: He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed against teeth. Hot air flows from Derek's breath and into the cold.
C: DEREK
D: You fucked with the wrong bull.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Goddamn, man!
N: Danny watches his brother from the front porch.
C: DANNY
D: Let the cops handle it, Der!
C: DEREK
D: Fuck that. The cops will let him walk.
N: Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.
C: DEREK
D: Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck? Open your mouth and put it on the corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach you a little lesson.
E: then
C: DANNY
D: Derek!?
C: DEREK
D: Get in the fucking house, Dan!
N: Danny doesn't move.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on, man. Call an ambulance.
C: DEREK
D: My dad gave me that truck, motherfucker. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Put your mouth on the corner of the fucking curb!
N: Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.
C: DANNY
D: The cops are comin' Der'
N: Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his outstretched mouth.
C: DEREK
D: What the fuck did you say? You just threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?
C: DANNY
E: anticipating
N: No! Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head - completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.
C: DANNY
D: Holy fucking shit! Derek! What the hell was that for?! Jesus!
E: crying
N: The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT. DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his knees. His eyes are remorseless.
C: DANNY
D: Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder is always with us. It's almost an institution." That couldn't rang more true than with me.
E: V/O
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WET STREET - THE CRIME SCENE - LATER
N: FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from the house by two uniformed cops and RASMUSSEN.
C: DANNY
D: Bobby Lawrence died of massive head trauma early that morning.
E: V/O
N: Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended to thoroughly.
C: DANNY
D: Six months after that...Derek was convicted and sentenced to seven years for voluntary manslaughter...to be served at the California State Penitentiary in Chino.
E: V/O
N: Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the car. He stares at his brother and sister as police lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes off down the street.
C: DANNY
D: Prosecutors wanted murder one for my brother's torture method...but there wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.
E: V/O
T: CUT TO:
N: OMIT
S: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES
N: They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He continues typing.
C: DANNY
D: Over the next year we'd lose our house and the rest of our father's pension to attorney fees. My mother...much to all of our surprise...stood by Derek.
E: V/O continuing
N: Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.
S: INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV
N: He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door.
C: JASON
D: We're here, dude.
C: CHRIS
D: Drop your dick and grab your stick.
C: DANNY
D: I told you I can't tonight.
C: DORIS
D: Danny?
E: O.S. from the couch
C: DANNY
D: It's okay, Mom.
N: The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards back to his bedroom. He shuts his bedroom door.
S: INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME
N: Danny looks at the two.
C: DANNY
D: If I don't finish this thing I'm dead.
C: CHRIS
D: Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow. You can't miss the party.
C: JASON
D: Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to grab your ass.
C: DANNY
D: She did?
C: CHRIS
D: You gotta hit that shit. It's the only fun thing that's legal anymore.
E: nodding
N: The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it.
C: DANNY
D: Hello?
S: INT. DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY
N: The only illumination shines through the window from the street. Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk phone, all packed up and almost out the door.
C: SWEENEY
D: Dan?
C: DANNY
D: Yeah?
E: O.S.
C: SWEENEY
D: Dr. Sweeney.
T: INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION
C: DANNY
D: What's going on?
E: worried
C: SWEENEY
D: Nothing here. Is everything all right over there?
C: DANNY
D: Everything's fine.
C: SWEENEY
D: How's it comin'?
C: DANNY
D: I'm doing it right now.
C: CMRIS
D: Who is it, dude?
C: DANNY
D: It's Sweeney.
E: covering the receiver
C: CHRIS
D: Who?! Why is he calling here!? Fuck you, Sweeney! Asshole!
C: JASON
D: Get a fucking job, you reggie!
E: grabbing the receiver
N: Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends.
C: DANNY
D: You fuckers are going to get me booted! Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man.
E: into the receiver
C: SWEENEY
D: Just make sure it's on my desk tomorrow, Danny.
C: DANNY
D: It'll be there, alright!?
C: SWEENEY
D: It better be.
N: Sweeney hangs up abruptly. Danny slams the phone on the hook, gives it TME FINGER, and looks at his friends.
C: DANNY
D: Let's go.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT
N: A TRUCK sits across the street.
S: INT. TRUCK - DEREK AND SETH
N: They sit in the car as a band JAMS from Cam's house. Shiftless Seth throws on a black CRO-MAG t-shirt and tosses his work shirt in the back. He wolfs down a burger as Derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the floor.
C: SETH
D: You're an idiot if you ask me.
C: DEREK
D: I'm not asking you.
C: SETH
D: What if he writes something stupid and that nigger turns you in? Jesus. He didn't testify, Der. They can use that shit and re-try you.
N: Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger.
C: DEREK
D: Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth. He helped get me released.
N: Seth is a pathetic vision to Derek. Derek stares at him for several moments.
C: DEREK
D: I'm out, Seth.
N: Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek.
C: DEREK
D: I'm only going to tell you this once so pay attention. I'm done, Seth. I don't want you to come near me...near Dan...I want you to leave my family alone.
N: Seth stares and laughs at Derek.
C: SETH
D: You're serious.
C: DEREK
D: I'm dead fucking serious. No more phone calls, no more visits, no more nothing.
N: Seth doesn't know what to say.
C: DEREK
D: We don't exist as far as you're concerned, Seth.
C: SETH
D: I can't believe I'm hearing this shit come out of your mouth.
C: DEREK
D: Believe it, Seth. Believe it. I spent over three years away from my family. My family, Seth. For what?
C: SETH
D: For your country, fuckhole, that's what. I'd do a hundred years before I felt like that.
N: Seth gets out, slams the door, and walks to the party.
C: SETH
D: You're a motherfucking traitor!
N: Derek stares out the window and sighs.
S: EXT. STREET - DEREK'S POV
N: He watches the house. Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside.
C: DEREK
D: What the--? Shit.
S: INT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE - THE FRONT DOOR
T: CUT TO:
N: DICK NIXON plays a punk version of WHITE CHRISTMAS as skins slam dance.
S: EXT. CAMMERON'S BACK PATIO - A SKINHEAD
N: His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink. CASSANDRA, a frail, older, English woman with green hair and multiple piercings, approaches JASON at the keg.
C: CASSANDRA
D: You're full of shit!
C: JASON
D: If he ain't here, he's comin'.
S: INT. HOUSE - MORE SLAMMING
N: Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the kids. Derek walks in.
C: CHRIS
D: Yo! What's up, Fat Seth!?
N: Seth throws Chris against the wall.
C: SETH
D: I'm not fat, cockwart! I'm husky!
C: CMRIS
D: Okay! I'm sorry, bro!
C: DANNY
D: Take it easy, dude!
N: Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt. Chris and Jason stare at him like he's gonna hurt him.
C: DANNY
D: What're you doin'?!
C: DEREK
D: Your brother's a piece of shit!
N: Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins. Danny follows Seth towards the keg. DEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd. Quickly, Chris recognizes him.
C: CHRIS
D: Holy shit. Father Vinyard!?
C: JASON
D: Son of a bitch.
N: Derek looks at the two kids.
C: JASON
D: I'm Jason and that's Chris! We're friends with your brother!
N: They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the scene.
C: CHRIS
D: You're a fuckin' god, man!
N: JASON No shit!
C: DEREK
D: Do me a favor. Grab Danny and get outta here!
N: The two boys look at each other and LAUGH.
C: CHRIS
D: We just got here, man!
C: DEREK
D: You what!?
N: Chris looks at Derek like he's dead.
C: DEREK
D: You don't have any homework?!
C: JASON
D: School doesn't exist anymore, Father.
N: Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do.
C: CHRIS
D: I wrote you. Two letters while you were in there! Did you get them?!
N: Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd, causing many an individual to double-take. Chris and Jason look on in wonderment.
S: EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA - A CROWD
N: TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song. Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT. DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman. IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few moments until he turns and walks away. He bumps into a girl and knocks her drink.
C: CASSANDRA
D: Excuse fuckin' me!
N: DEREK Sorry. She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close. CASSANDRA Derek?
C: DEREK
D: Cassandra.
C: CASSANDRA
D: Oh my God! They said you might be here but I didn't fucking believe 'em!
N: CURTIS, the M-16 on the side of his head perfectly intact, walks by Derek. He walks past Derek with his young son on his shoulders.
C: CURTIS
D: I hope what I heard ain't true, man. You better hightail it the fuck outta here if it is.
N: After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off.
C: CASSANDRA
D: You gotta chop that mop, Der!
N: Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette.
C: CASSANDRA
D: Stacey's meandering around here somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!
E: exhaling
N: Derek shakes his head.
C: DEREK
D: The only person I've seen is Seth.
C: CASSANDRA
D: Oh God. I'm sorry.
N: DEREK'S POV. He sees Cameron puts his arm around her and kiss her. Cameron sticks his hand down the back of her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger. Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron. Ca puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom. Stacey looks at Derek and follows them. LIZZY (0. S. ) Are you going in there? Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.
C: LIZZY
D: Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's looking for him?
N: Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.
S: INT. LARGE BEDROOM/OFFICE - A SHRINE TO HITLER
N: DEREM'S PoV. He stands in the doorwell and listens. White Power paraphernalia cover the walls. Articles, posters, everything. The room has a bed, a couch, a glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it. Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are strewn throughout the floor. Cameron sips a beer and talks with Dan. Stacey listens in the background.
C: CAMMERON
D: He won't do anything'drastic I hope.
C: DANNY
D: I gotta do that paper though.
C: CAMMERON
D: I thought you already turned that fucker in?
C: DANNY
D: My teacher cried to Sweeney, man. have to do another one.

D: Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny. And it's all a load of crap. You hear me? He's all about brainwashing. Don't get fucking fooled by it.

C: DEREK
D: It wasn't too bad.
C: CAMMERON
D: So what's all this self-righteous, born-again shit I'm hearing then?
N: Derek doesn't blink. Cameron smiles and points to a chair.
C: CAMMERON
D: Have a seat, Derek. Relax.
N: TIGHT ON CAMMERON. He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's uncomfortable stare.
C: CAMMERON
D: How was it in there with all those fuckin' monkeys, man? You're lucky they didn't kill you.
C: DEREK

D: I'm family, Cam? Is that why you came to see me all the time up there?
N: Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say.
C: CAMMERON
D: I had to distance myself from you after that.

D: Fuck you, Cameron. You're a fucking chicken hawk...praying on kids.
C: CAMMERON
D: I don't pray on fucking anyone.
C: DEREK
D: No. You fucking use them. To filter your insanity.
N: Cameron smiles in disbelief.
C: CAMMERON
D: You and Danny are like brothers to me, Derek. Come on, man.
C: DEREK
D: He's not your brother, Cameron. All right? He's my brother. You hear me, Cam?
E: after a beat
C: CAMMERON
D: Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don't think you can threaten me with this shit for a fuckin' second! I'm more important to him now then you ever were.
E: exploding
N: Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS COFFEE TABLE hard into Cammeron's knees. Cam screams in agony. Derek SLUGS him in the face and Cam RETALIATES with two of his own. They wrestle around the room and push their way into the BATHROOM.

N: Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror ONCE MORE.
C: DEREK
D: Shut the fuck up! You're gonna stay away! That's what you're gonna do!
N: Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by PLUNGING it into the toilet. He pulls him back up and they face the mirror.
C: DEREK
D: It's over.
N: Derek stares at him in silence. CAMMERON RETALIATES. He forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him. He throws two punches at Derek -- one in the stomach and one to the face that opens his lip. He misses on his third and Derek gets the upper hand. BACK TO THE MIRROR. Derek prepares to crash Cam's face into the shards of glass one last time. The final blow. As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls back at the very last moment. Derek, noticing Cam's condition, throws him into the tub. Derek throws him a towel, grabs one for his lip, and exits.
S: EXT. SHED AREA - A GROUP OF 20 NAZI'S
N: They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for another set. The singer inquires about his DRUMMER. Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn the way. Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random skins as Derek passes by.

D: What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin' ground screaming?! That bullshit with Cammeron is nothing, Derek!
E: then
C: DEREK
D: I don't care.
N: Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it.
C: STACEY
D: Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers deserved what they got. They deserved to die! And just like Cameron and Seth and a million others out there...I'll believe that 'til the day I fucking die. I will. Nothing will ever change that either.
N: Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away.
S: EXT. PATIO - DEREM'E POV
N: He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding glass window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg. All the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer. Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background. Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg.
C: ET AL
D: Forty-five! Forty-six! Forty- seven...!
N: Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a pig. All the guys laugh.
C: SETH
D: Why the fuck did you pump it?! I coulda gone for a minute at least!
E: grabbing Danny
N: Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek. He FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.
C: DEREK
D: Let him go, Seth.
N: Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a moment to identify the source. He draws his 9mm Baretta and points it at Derek's head from four feet away.
C: SETH
D: Where's Cameron?
N: Derek stares directly into the BARREL.
C: DANNY
D: Seth, man!? Come on!
E: frightened
N: Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head.
C: SETH
D: I'd be doing America a great fucking favor, let me tell you.
C: STACEY
D: Do it, Seth.
N: Seth glances at her and Derek quickly GRABS the pistol. A shot goes off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles the pistol away and punches Seth in the STOMACH. Falling to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once more and it's over.
S: INT. CAM'S BATHROOM - CASSANDRA AND CURTIS

N: Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny.
C: DEREK
D: Come with me right now.
N: He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan and hauls ass down the back alley. DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed, Danny bolts back into the house to get his board.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE BLVD. - SLEEPING HOMELESS
N: Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells. Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the clickity clack behind him. DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two crash into the street as a car henks from the inside lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher in the face.
C: DANNY
D: Fucking asshole!
N: Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the sidewalk. Just in time.
C: DEREK
D: What the luck are you thinking!?
C: DANNY
D: What are you thinking!? Friends don't fight friends, Der! They stick together!
C: DEREK
D: They're not friends, Dan!
C: DANNY
D: What the hell are they then?!
N: Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a BUS STOP BENCH.
C: DEREK
D: Just sit there and relax for a second.
C: DANNY
D: I don't wanna relax! You looked like an idiot back there!
N: Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother, transfixed in thought.

He notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods. WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA. Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them. A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD. From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK, the crazy looking leader.

C: LAMONT
D: Oh shit! Sorry, man! Forgot who the luck I was talking to there for a second. Let me ask you this one though cause I don't know the white man's take. You like eating pussy?
E: after a beat

S: 129 INT. SHOWER - TIGHT ON DEREE
N: As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand and sits on.the bottom of the tub. He looks at it a long time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself.

S: INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - MORNING - FLASHBACK
N: The place is immaculate. DENNIS VINYARD, the father of the household, eats his breakfast in his LA COUNTY FIREFIGHTER UNIFORM. Vintage fireman material: muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome. A pretty and well-dressed Doris SINGS while she scrambles eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers.
C: DANNY
D: That was Dad. They were best friendS. Fathers and sons are never best friends...but they were..
E: V/O
N: YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells to the back.
C: DORIS
D: Breakfast!
C: DENNIS
D: Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek!
C: DORIS
D: So what's this all about, Dennis?
N: Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny. YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos, walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all onto the ground and sits at the table.
C: DENNIS
D: Good morning.
C: DEREK
D: Good morning.
N: Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work. Young Danny eats quietly.
C: DORIS
D: What about this gang stuff?
C: DENNIS
D: Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a deal. All departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today.
C: DEREK
D: What for?
C: DENNIS
D: A guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood...changin' a valve on a hydrant. LAPD is worried that more firefighters will become targets. That's what this bullshit is about. A good father this guy was though and now he's in intensive care because of some goddamn--! They've pretty much declared war on LAPD and us.
E: sipping his coffee
C: DORIS
D: Why you guys though? I can see them but the fire department?
C: DENNIS
D: They think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it. So now we got two fights goin' on at one goddamn time.
N: Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.
C: DENNIS
D: Dayins! Get in here!
E: to the bedroom
C: DAVINA
D: I'm coming right now! Jesus!
E: O.S.
C: DENNIS
D: I'll tell you one more thing. This "affirmative blaction" shit is driving me up the fucking wall. Firefighters gettin' 99's on their tests while rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk away with the job.
C: DANNY
D: Don't we have to have "affirmative action?"
C: DENNIS
D: Not when a job requires ability. No.
C: DORIS
D: A lot of people say otherwise, Danny. Including me.
C: DENNIS
D: A lot of people don't know shit, either.
N: Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like she wants to smack it. He turns back and disarms her with a look.
C: DENNIS
D: If I'm fightin' a brush fire... surrounded by thousand degree flames...who would I want watchin' my back? A guy who scores a 99 or a guy who scores a sixty? You don't see half the NBA with whites, gooks and spics.
E: then
C: DORIS
D: Nooo...what you don't see are minorities on the boards of Fortune 500 companies cause whites won't stand for it.
C: DENNIS
D: Doris! I'm tired of your damn argument! You sound like an idiot!
C: DEREK
D: Sweeney actually had a pretty good take on affirmative action the other day.
C: DENNIS
D: Really? I didn't know you spoke "African", Derek? Where'd you learn that shit? Johannesberg?
E: smiling
N: Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles. Danny looks at them, not really understanding. Doris stares down Dennis.
C: DORIS
D: Honey? Please don't speak that way. They don't--
C: DENNIS
D: How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?! I'm speakin' fineP Hey. Don't let that him confuse you over there, Derek. Look at me. This shit he's pulling is a load of crap. Hey. Look at me, Derek. I mean it. If we keep givin' niggers everything, there'll be nothing left for us.
E: quickly to Derek
N: Derek and Danny stare at their father, not knowing how to react.
C: DORIS
D: You can be a stupid son of a bitch sometimes.
C: DENNIS
D: And then we have naive fools like her.
C: DORIS
D: I really hate you with a passion some times.
N: An upset Doris exits the room past YOUNG DAVINA. Dennis looks to Derek.
C: DENNIS
D: You know what I mean though, right?
C: DEREK
E: nodding
N: Yeah.
C: DAVINA
D: Good morning.
E: to the family
N: She sits. Her lips glare excessively this morning.
C: DENNIS
D: Well...good morning, Miss Monroe! Look at you. You look like a star.
E: smiling
C: DEREK
D: I like that color, Davina.
C: DAVINA
D: Thanks
C: DENNIS
D: You did like it.
N: Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin.
C: DAVINA
D: Come on, Dad.

D: It totally sucks. And we all sympathize with you, too.
N: Everyone laughs but Dan, still shaken over his mother.
C: DENNIS
D: You got practice today?
E: Shifting to Danny
N: Danny shakes his head no.
C: DANNY
D: Coach's sick.
C: DENNIS
D: You wanna go to Der's game with me?
N: DANNY Sure.
C: DENNIS
D: (quickly to Derek} Santa Monica High tonight, right?
N: DEREK Yep.
C: DENNIS
D: Perfect. Ben'll whip us up a couple of double deckers and we'll head over.
E: to Danny
C: DANNY
E: smiling
N: Okay. Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and messes up his hair. BACK QUICKLY TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY - PRESENT
N: He stops typing and almost cries. He leans back in his chair and and stares himself in the side mirror. He feels his bald head, almost exploring.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEN'S BURGER SHOP - LATE NIGHT
N: A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up, drunk and bloody, stare at the man.
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: Spare change for a cheeseburger?
C: SETH
D: Get a job and buy one why don't you.
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: God bless you.
C: SETH
D: Fuck you.
N: Seth stumbles into the shop. Cam stares at the homeless man, psychotically.
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: Fifty cents is all I ask. Vietnam, man.
N: I was in
C: CAMMERON
D: Really? So you've had what? Thirty years to get your shit together?
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: All I want is something to eat.
C: CAMMERON
D: There are plenty of fuckin' dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam boy. Go get yourself one.
N: In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands.
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: Did I do something?
C: CAMMERON
D: You're a disgrace to the white race. If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless his soul...he would have you shot.
C: HOMELESS MAN
D: Fuck you then. Now and forever. Fuck you.
N: Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times.
C: CAMMERON
D: Noooo. Fuck you.
N: QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes. They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off.
S: INT. BURGER SHOP - CAMHERON AND SETH
T: CUT TO:
N: Seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time. Cameron smokes across from him and watches Seth eat like a pig. He takes a look at the homeless man outside who still lays motionless. Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE.
C: CAMMERON
D: I think I need to go to the hospital.
C: SETH
D: Seriously?
C: CAMMERON
D: I don't know. I think so.
C: SETH
D: Where's Stacey?
C: CAMMERON
D: Who gives a fuck?
N: Seth takes a bite and chews.
C: SETH
D: Derek's a fuckin' traitor pussy.
C: CAMMERON
D: Well...we might be pussies too if we got treated the way he did.
C: SETH
D: What do you mean?
C: CAMMERON
D: Stevie McCormick called...old school Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin' life. He hated Derek. Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in there.
E: exhaling
C: SETH
D: Fucking A.
E: overwhelmed
N: Seth continues to eat. Cammeron looks out the window and hates what he sees.
C: CAMMERON
D: Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?
N: SETH What? CAMMERON'S POV. A large, mature and sharp-looking BLACK MAN helps A BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of a RED BMW. THEY KISS. Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his cigarette as the couple ENTERS.
C: CAMMERON
D: Is there anything sacred in this country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey. Stop feeding your face for a second and look behind you.
E: looking at the two
N: Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple. He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous atevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cameron laughs. The black man turns and looks at the two.
C: CAMMERON
D: Can we help you with something? Do you have any questions about the menu?
C: BLACK MAN
D: No questions.
C: CAMMERON
D: I recommend either the "Big Ben Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special." Ben'll replace the dark meat with the white meat if you ask nicely.
C: BLACK MAN
D: What's your problem, pal?
E: fed up
C: CAMMERON
D: I ain't your fucking pal first of all. Secondly...I don't have problems. People who luck with me have problems.
C: WHITE GIRL
D: Come on. Let's get out of here.
C: CAMMERON
D: Hey! What a great idea! You got a clever little whatever it is there. I'd listen to it if I were you.
C: BLACK MAN
D: You're not me.
C: CAMHERON
D: And I thank God Almighty every day for that, believe me.
E: smiling
C: SETH
D: Excuse me? Tyrone?
C: BLACK MAN
D: My name's not Tyrone either.
C: SETH
D: Whatever. Why can't you stick to your own race?
C: WHITE GIRL
D: Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes come from?!
E: disgusted
C: CAMMERON
D: What the luck difference does it make where we come from, bitch? I'm from a place called America. A place that used to be a nice place to live before it became fuckin' Africa-America.
C: BLACK MAN
D: You ignorant mother--
N: Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun totally visible to the couple.
C: SETH
D: You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole? Do you? Make your move now if you do. If you don't...get the luck out of my sight. Cause I'm real close to shoving my piece up your girlfriend's stinky pussy.
N: The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.
C: CAMMERON
D: Everything's hunky dory, Ben! No problemo. Only us white folk.
E: smiling
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - A DIGITAL CLOCK
N: It reads 2:36 a.m. Shiftless Derek lifts a sleeping Danny off the computer keyboard. He helps him into the bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze.
C: DEREK
D: Did you "save" it?
E: softly
N: An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks back into the bathroom to grab his towel off the floor. He looks at his SWASTIKA TAT in the mirror and sighs to himself. He turns off the light and exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BURGER JOINT - SETH AND CAMMERON
N: Seth finishes his display of gluttony.
C: CAMMERON
D: It wouldn't irritate me so much if the ratio was a little more even.
C: SETH
D: What's that?
C: CAMMERON
D: Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost all of those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and I'm fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't mind so much if it were more even.
E: going mad
C: SETH
D: Huge dicks, Cam. That's all it is.
C: CAMMERON
D: I used to think that too but...it's gotta be more, man. It has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are they? It's politically correct... that's what it is. White women...bein' seen with the coloreds...it's great for their image. Bitches today want to be known as bein' fuckin' color blind.
C: SETH
D: They get off on it.
C: CAMMERON
D: And you can't really blame Tyrone.
C: SETH
D: Why the fuck not?
C: CAMMERON
D: Well...how'd you like to drag around some fat fly girl? I wouldn't.
C: SETH
D: No shit. Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!
E: imitating
N: Seth and Cammeron laugh and head outside--leaving a mess on the table.
S: EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - THE CHEROKEE FROM EARLIER
N: The white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right.
S: INT. CHEROKEE - HENRY'S POV
N: Henry sits up front with JEROME, nervous and scared. The three thugs in back lock and load.
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: You gonna waste 'em?
C: JEROME
D: Only if we have to.
N: Jerome grabs a baseball bat and they quietly get out.
S: INT. VAN - TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY
N: Me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on an oblivious Seth and Cammeron.
S: EXT. GRAVEL PARKING LOT - HENRY'S POV
N: The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it. Jerome raises the bat as they close in and we--
T: FADE TO:
S: INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - BIRDS CHIRPING
N: Danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find some stubble on his chin.
S: INT. BEDROOM - A SLICK DEREK
N: He stares into the mirror in a coat and pants. Danny rushes to get his things together.
C: DANNY
D: I'm printing it up and we're out of here.
C: DEREK
D: Hurry up.
N: Derek walks out into the living room.
S: INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM - DORIS
N: She's on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead. Davina sits on the couch and writes. Derek just smiles.
C: DORIS
D: Wow. What happened?
C: DEREK
D: I gotta see my parole officer.
C: DAVINA
D: Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk?
C: DEREK
D: I've got everything on disk.
N: Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom. Doris looks at Derek.
C: DORIS
D: You look good.
N: Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek.
C: DEREK
D: We're getting out of here soon. Is that okay with you?
C: DORIS
D: I'd love it. Do you think I should color my hair?
E: after a beat
N: DEREK Yes. He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment. He thinks to himself.
C: DORIS
D: I'm glad you made it back. I wasn't too sure I was going to see you again. You know how I get.
N: Filled with regret, he nods.
C: DEREK
D: You think you'll be able to forgive me? Someday maybe?
C: DORIS
D: You're my son. Of course I will.
N: Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction.
C: DEREK
D: Look at me. I'm such a pussy.
C: DORIS
D: No you're not.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE BLVD. - A NEWSPAPER MACHINE
N: Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him. Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.
S: INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POV
N: He takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems normal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers, dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other direction. Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a short Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter grabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.
C: DEREK
D: What do you want?
C: DANNY
D: Maple bar and a...large milk.
N: Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits. She wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.
C: DEREK
D: You look pretty.
E: to the girl
N: She laughs.
C: TISHA
D: Thank you.
C: DEREK
D: How do I look?
C: BLACK GIRL
D: Fine.
E: bashfully
N: DANNY'S POV. He looks up from the paper. He watches the girl together with his brother.
C: DEREK
D: What's your name?
N: BLACK GIRL Tisha.
C: DEREK
D: How old are you, Tisha?
N: She holds up four fingers. Derek smiles.
C: BLACK MOTHER
D: Come here, Tisha.
E: staring at Derek
N: Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they make their way down the street. Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk inside.
C: DEREK
D: What's goin' on?
C: SWEENEY
D: We need to talk, Derek.
C: DEREK
D: How'd you find out I was here?
C: SWEENEY
D: We were just at your apartment.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in front of Ben's Burgets early this morning.
N: Derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds.
C: DEREK
D: How bad?
C: RASMUSSEN
D: They'll live. They must have been looking for somebody else.
E: then
N: Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away. Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him. He eyes TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes.
C: SWEENEY
D: Are they coming after you?
C: DEREK
D: Fuckin' A.
N: Sweeney sighs.
C: SWEENEY
D: I don't know. You might have to talk to your old crew though.
E: after a long beat
N: Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother.
C: DEREK
D: I can't, Sweeney.
C: SWEENEY
D: Try, Derek. Okay?
N: Derek senses the danger in his voice.
C: SWEENEY
D: Okay? Before it explodes.
N: Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.
C: SWEENEY
D: And watch your back.
N: Derek nods.
C: SWEENEY
D: You showing up today?
E: back to Danny
N: Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes. SWEENEY Good.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE HIGH - DEREK AND DANNY
N: They are outside the fence surrounding the field. Students head off to morning class.
C: DEREK
D: Hey. Keep your head up, alright? I'm going to take care of this.
C: DANNY
D: How?
C: DEREK
D: I don't know. I'll figure it out though. You gonna be okay?
C: DANNY
D: Yeah.
N: The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.
C: DANNY
D: I gotta turn that paper in.
N: Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.
C: DEREK
D: Hey.
C: DANNY
D: What?
C: DEREK
D: Come here.
N: Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one thing but something else comes out.
C: DEREK
D: I'll see you at home.
N: Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns and walks down the street. COP #1 You need a lift anywhere?
C: DEREK
D: Nope.
N: Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence, and stares at the school.
S: INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY
N: Students rush past them. Danny kisses Lizzy and she hurries off to class. He pushes on the men's room door.
S: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - SAME
N: Danny enters, sets his "AMERICAN HISTORY X" PAPER on top of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the urinal. He finishes, flushes and turns. Standing there is LITTLE HENRY. A GUN IN HIS HAND.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus Christ. What are you doing, Henry?
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: What does it look like I'm doin'?
E: afraid
C: DANNY
D: Come on, man, no. You don't want to do this. Come on. Henry?
N: THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol. It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest. He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two kids who just entered bolt for help. Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass is raking his lungs.
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: Danny?
E: terrified
N: Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper. He blinks, coughs, twitches. And dies.
C: LITTLE HENRY
D: Vinyard? Danny?
N: Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the cold tile floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALL AT VENICE HIGH BATHROOM - YELLOW POLICE TAPE
N: Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around and cry. Rasmussen brings THE BLOODY PAPER over to Sweeney. Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is interrupted.
C: RASMUSSEN
D: He won't let go. Will you talk to him?
S: INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY
N: Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over, crouches, and talks to Derek's back.
C: SWEENEY
D: Derek? You gotta let him go, man. They gotta get him outta here.
N: DEREK I can't. Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself. He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the hall.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA
N: Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.
C: SWEENEY
D: Derek! I know what you're thinkin' right now and I want you to forget about it!
C: DEREK
D: How the luck do you know what I'm thinkin', Sweeney!?
C: SWEENEY
D: Cause I'm thinkin' the same damn thing!
N: Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed Sweeney.
C: DEREK
D: They shot him in a fucking...pisshole!
C: SWEENEY
D: And goin' after them won't bring him back. Don't do it, Derek. Please, man. You've come too far. The war is over.
N: Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's shoulder.
C: DEREK
D: It stops now, Sweeney.
N: Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.
C: DANNY
D: We've heard it a million times, a Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord."
E: V/O
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DANNY AND HENRY
N: A still of the two immediately after the murder. We move in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny.
C: DANNY
D: Vengeance brought about by hate...and fear. When it points its head in our direction, we take notice and everything changes. The way we choose our friends, the way we protect our families, the way we create enemies out of strangers. Welcome to America.
E: V/O then
N: TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES. They are gently pushed shut by Henry's two small BLACK FINGERS. THE END
