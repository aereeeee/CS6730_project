C: HIBERNATING GROUNDHOGS
D: A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow sleeping off the end of a long winter.
N: ROLL CREDITS AND THEME MUSIC
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING
N: The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground, and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the early morning light.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME
N: PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall, talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME
N: CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME
N: Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's pointing to -- a national weather map.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME
N: The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio. -2- We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING
N: We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface. As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline blanket. GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his head in the door.
C: HAWLEY
D: Christ, what a pit. Phil" The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley. It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.
N: PHIL (SLEEPY) What?
C: HAWLEY
D: It's February first, Phil. You know what tomorrow is? Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart, rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but clearly a guy with a lot of personality.
C: PHIL
D: Oh, no! Not again. He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.
E: catching on
C: PHIL
D: Forget it! I'm not going.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9 Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as WPGH - Pittsburgh. Phil ducks into the studio. -3-
S: INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
N: Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather stats up on a chart.
C: PHIL
D: Get away from me. I'm working.
C: HAWLEY
D: So what's the outlook? We gonna get that blizzard? Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title.
C: PHIL
D: No way. All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg.
C: HAWLEY
D: Good, 'cause you're going up to Punxsutawney to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and I want you back here in time to do the five.
E: with authority
C: PHIL
D: Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will you! I covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the year before that.
C: HAWLEY
D: And you'll do it :next year and the year after, too. When I worked in San Diego, I covered the swallows coming back to Capistrano for ten years in a row.
C: PHIL
D: You should've killed the guy who made you do that.
C: HAWLEY
D: I wanted to do it.
C: PHIL
D: Then you should've killed yourself. I don't want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life.
N: -4-
C: HAWLEY
D: It's a cute story. He comes out, he looks around, he wrinkles up his little nose, he sniffs around a little, he sees his shadow, he d oesn't see his shadow-- it's nice. People like it.
C: PHIL
D: Many people are morons.
C: HAWLEY
D: Just do it.
C: PHIL
D: What'11 you give me? Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.
C: HAWLEY
D: I'll give you Rita. Rita, could you come here for a second? I got a little job for you. Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent, personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short, a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this point to realize it.
E: to Phil calls her over
N: PHIL (TEASING) You can't send Rita out on a story like this. She's just a cub, a pup, still wet behind the ears. Look at her. Her ears are sopping wet. This needs a Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a big story. People need to know. RITA (INTRIGUED) What's the story?
C: HAWLEY
D: The Punxsutawney Groundhog Festival.
C: RITA
D: Gil, if it's all right with you I ' d rather follow-up on the nurses' strike.
N: -5-
C: HAWLEY
D: You can do the nurses when you get back. Just take the squeaky wheel here up to Punxsutawney and get him back in one piece. Okay?
C: RITA
D: Yeah, okay. Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still, she finds him appealing in an odd way.
N: PHIL (PLEASANTLY) You know, this could be extremely interesting.
C: RITA
D: I've never done a weather story before. What's Punxsutawney like?
C: PHIL
D: Oh, it's an enchanted place. A magical world. It's the Constantinople of the whole Western Appalachian-Susquehanna Drainage system.
C: RITA
D: Do you always joke?
C: PHIL
D: About 70 to 80% of the time. Inside I'm actually a very shy and sensitive person.
C: RITA
D: A lot of people around here think you're not very sincere.
C: PHIL
D: Tell me the names of these people.
C: RITA
D: I'll line up a crew and transportation. If you don't feel like driving, we can all go up in the van together.
C: PHIL
D: I think I'll take my own car. I ' m not that fond of my fellow man.
N: -6- RITA (EXITING) Nice attitude.
C: PHIL
D: Nice face. Why don't you ride up with me?
E: calls after her
C: RITA
D: No, thanks. STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.
S: INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER
N: Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching himself on the TV monitor.
C: PHIL
D: They don't really think of me as a weatherman around here. More of a "personality," but with the credibility of a first-class broadcast journalist. Once you look at my tape I think you'll see what they mean. Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little scary.
E: on the phone
N: STEPHANIE (BITTERLY) I just want to know one thing: did I do something wrong or are you just tired of me or what? I have to know. Phil sighs.
C: PHIL
D: Dan, can I call you back? I've just been handed something and I better get on it... ...Okay, thanks.
E: on the phone he picks up some papers and rustles them for effect
N: -7- He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for privacy. PHIL (KINDLY) You didn't do anything wrong, Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of you. It's just that I don't have time for a real relationship right now. I told you that the first time we went out.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship.
E: getting close
C: PHIL
D: (gently pushing her
C: AWAY)
D: I'm different. I really meant it! Things are really starting to move for me now. I ' m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life. I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job. I want that. This is just the beginning for me. I can't waste any more time.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time?
C: PHIL
D: Our relationship? We went out a total of four times! And only twice did anything happen. It was fun but I don't see that as a big commitment.
C: STEPHANIE
D: I had our charts done. My astrologer says we're extremely compatible. There may even be some past lives involvement here.
E: closing in again
C: PHIL
D: See? So we've already done this. Let's move on. Next case.
C: STEPHANIE
D: You know what's wrong with you, Phil? You're selfish. You don't have time for anyone but yourself.
N: -8-
C: PHIL
D: That's what I ' m trying to tell you. You don't want to be with me. You can do better. Look, Stephanie, if I ever said or did anything to mislead you I'm sorry for that, but right now I have to do this groundhog thing and I don't have a handle on it yet. He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his jacket.
C: PHIL
D: I'll tell you what. I ' m going to do some serious thinking while I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay? He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her standing there with a malevolent look on her face.
E: CONT.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON
N: A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane highway through the winter landscape of West Central Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter. Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen Like it Wet."
C: PHIL
D: I'm on my way to Punxsutawney... Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun? I think that all depends on you.
E: V.O. on his earphone forced to repeat it, a little embarrassed
S: INT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both hands.
C: PHIL
D: . . . . I thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours....So I ' m supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne? Thanks.
N: Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in.
T: CUT TO:
C: A SIGN
D: "Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his arm. The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts of town.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATER
N: The van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.
S: EXT . MOTEL - LATER
N: The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets out. Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.
C: PHIL
D: Rita! I can't stay here. Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van.
E: calls out
N: LARRY (MUTTERING) Prima donnas.
C: RITA
D: It's okay. I'll handle it. She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another call on his earphone.
C: RITA
D: What's the problem, Phil?
C: PHIL
D: I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable. It's like a minimum security prison. I'm not staying here.
N: -10-
C: RITA
D: You're not staying here.
N: PHIL (BRIGHTENING) I ' m not?
C: RITA
D: No, Larry and I don't care but I thought you might, so I booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry Street. Here's the address. She hands him a card.
N: PHIL (PLEASED) Great. That's great. That's the mark of a really good producer. Making the talent happy.
C: RITA
D: Whatever I can do.
C: PHIL
D: Really? Will you be my love slave?
C: RITA
D: Whatever I can do within reason. Would you like to have dinner with Larry and me?
C: PHIL
D: No thanks, I've seen Larry eat. Why don't you ditch Larry and let me take you someplace nice?
C: RITA
D: You mean like a date?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah.
C: RITA
D: Oh, no.
C: PHIL
D: Okay. I get it. You're a little intimidated by me, you're all excited about the shoot tomorrow, you want everything to go just perfect. I understand. You just get some sleep. Tomorrow will be great.
N: -11-
C: RITA
D: Well, that's something to look forward to. I'll see you in the morning. He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.
C: LARRY
D: Did he actually call himself "the talent?" Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHERRY STREET - DAWN
N: The first light of morning colors the sky behind the Cherry Street Inn, a rambling, white Victorian bed and breakfast. CLOSE UP - CLOCK A digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got You, Babe." SUPER: FEBRUARY 2
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Phil sits up in bed and looks around the room. The decor is typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints, and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. His suit is hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed. A iradio, DEEJAY and his SIDEKICK come on with hyped-up, drivetime Chappy talk." Phil stares at the radio and listens to them.
C: DEEJAY
D: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there
C: TODAY1
D: Phil grimaces and swings out of bed.
C: SIDEK ICK
D: It's cold out there everyday. W hat is this-- Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.
N: -12-
C: DEEJAY
D: Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing--
C: SIDEKICK
D: That "blizzard thing?" Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.
C: SIDEKICK
D: Oh, here's the report: the National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.
E: CONT.
C: DEEJAY
D: Yes they are, but there's another reason today is very special--
C: SIDEKICK
D: Es pec ia lly cold--
C: DEEJAY
D: Especially cold, okay, but the big question on everybody's lips--
C: SIDEKICK
D: Ch ap pe d lips--
C: DEEJAY
D: :--on their chapped lips, right-- Do you think Phil's going to come out and see his shadow?
C: SIDEKICK
D: Punxsutawney Phil. Phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.
C: DEEJAY
D: That's right, rodent lovers!
N: IT'S--
C: BOTH DEEJAYS
D: Groundhog Day1 SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS. Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror.
C: PHIL
D: Never again.
E: to himself

N: -13-
S: INT. CORRIDOR - DAWN
N: Phil heads for the breakfast room of the inn, now well-dressed in a suit and tie, a nice overcoat slung over his arm. A CHUBBY MAN passes.
C: CHUBBY MAN
D: Morning .
C: PHIL
D: Morning .
C: CHUBBY MAN
D: Think it'll be an early Spring?
C: PHIL
D: I ' m predicting March 21st.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a breakfast buffet. An old spinet piano stands in the corner. One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful of guests are seated around the room, eating. The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee.
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
C: PHIL
D: Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs. Lancaster.
E: with mock civility
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Would you like some coffee?
C: PHIL
D: I don't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here.
N: MRS. LANCASTER (BLANKLY) I don't really know --
C: PHIL
D: Forget it. This '11 be fine.
N: -14-
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities.
E:  as she pours
C: PHIL
D: My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but I'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as .Philadelphia. (off her surprised
C: LOOK)
D: You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy. He heads for the door.
N: ;MRS. LANCASTER Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors?
C: PHIL
D: Unfortunately yes. Phil exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Sipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET -KPUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS
N: There are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making the annual trek to see the groundhog. An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without taking any notice.
C: MAN
D: Hey, Phil!
E: O.C.
N: -15- A big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing right up to him. There is something about this guy that makes us dislike him on sight.
C: NED
D: Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil looks at him vaguely.
C: PHIL
D: I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh--
E: at a loss
C: NED
D: My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heckrfire remember you. Well? Phil stares, trying to remember.
C: NED
D: Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head. Come on, buddy. Case Western High?
C: PHIL
D: Ned?
C: NED
D: I see you clicking through that brain of yours. Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing! Ned Ryerson, did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate. Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a couple of times-- 'til you told me not to anymore. Well?
N: PHIL (RESIGNED) Ned Ryerson.
C: NED
D: Bing!
C: PHIL
D: So what're you doing with yourself, Ned?
C: NED
D: Phil, I sell insurance.
N: -16-
C: PHIL
D: No kidding.
E: sorry he asked
C: NED
D: Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right?
C: PHIL
D: You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk to you but I really have to-- Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint.
C: NED
D: That's okay. I'll walk with you. When I see an opportunity, I charge it, like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single .premium life? That could be the ticket for you, buddy. God, it's good to see you! Hey, what're you doing for dinner?
C: PHIL
D: Dinner? Umm, I don't think that's going to work for me. As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs like a donkey.
C: NED
D: Hey, look out for that first step! It's a doozy! Phil looks at him with murderous contempt.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN
N: A big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here. An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters. -17- Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.
C: RITA
D: How could he be late?
C: LARRY
D: Prima donnas.
C: RITA
D: It's just so-- inconsiderate.
C: LARRY
D: What happens to some people? They're born nice. They grow up nice. You put 'em on TV and - bam! Prima donnas. Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.
C: RITA
D: Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil. Over here! Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark near the rail fence.
C: RITA
D: Where've you been?
C: PHIL
D: I got hung up with some jerk I went to high school with. So, did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.
C: RITA
D: You're incredible.
C: PHIL
D: Who told you?
C: RITA
D: Ready when you are. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence. The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney Phil.
C: RITA
D: Looks like they're starting. Roll tape.
N: -18-
C: LARRY
D: Rolling. Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly snaps into announce mode.
C: PHIL
D: Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn here, to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil, the world's most famous weatherman, the groundhog, who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good. A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it and retreats.
E: to camera
C: PHIL
D: And here's the big moment we've all been waiting for. Let's just see what Mr. Groundhog has to say. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about as far away from the cameras as he can get.
C: PHIL
D: Hey! Over here, you little weasel! Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole.
C: PHIL
D: Great shot, huh, folks? Well, that was certainly worth the trip. Now we'll be hearing from Mr. Buster Greene, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the so-called Seer of Seers who will interpret for us. BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.
N: -19- B U ST E R He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.
C: PHIL
D: Well, that's it. Sorry you couldn't be here in person to share the electric moment. This is one event where televison really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered to watch a large squirrel predict the weather, and I for one am deeply grateful to have been a part of it. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry cuts the camera.
E: sarcastic, to camera
C: RITA
D: You want to try one that's a little sweeter?
E: to Phil
C: PHIL
D: That's as sweet as I get. I'm outa here. As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.
E: to Rita
N: LARRY (MUTTERS) Prima donnas.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT . DINER - LATER
N: Phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud and lively cafe. Rita enters, sees him sitting there, crosses to his table and sits down across from him.
C: RITA
D: That was really lousy.
C: PHIL
D: Is it my fault the little rat went south on us?
N: -20-
C: RITA
D: A real professional would have handled it. You acted like it was a personal insult. Who do you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer?
C: PHIL
D: God, you really take this stuff seriously, don't you.
C: RITA
D: Yes, I do. As far as I ' m concerned there are no little stories, Phil. Only little reporters with big egos who think they're too good for the job they have to do.
C: PHIL
D: You really don't know me very well, do you. 'Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me. I care! Call me a cockeyed optimist but I happen to think there's more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night.
E: trying to look hurt
C: RITA
D: Is that so.
C: PHIL
D: Yes, that is so. Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond. Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.
C: PHIL
D: So as far as us getting together, would you say the glass is half empty or half full? Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table.
C: LARRY
D: You ready? We better get going if we ' re going to stay ahead of the weather.
E: to Rita
C: PHIL
D: You don't have to rush off, you know. That storm is 'going to miss us completely.
N: -21-
C: RITA
D: Nice working with you, Phil. See you around. Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.

S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just starting to fall.
C: PHIL
D: I'll call you after I see the network guy. I should be back there in a couple of hours...What?...1 can't hear you-- you're breaking up...Hello? Sabrina?
E: V.O on the earphone
S: INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates. The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield wipers.
C: PHIL
D: Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit! He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing moves. He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a parking lot.
C: PHIL
D: No. No!
S: EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY "J PATROLMEN.
C: PHIL
D: What's going on, Officer?
N: -22-
C: PATROLMAN
D: Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1 the road. Big accident up ahead. Blizzard movin1 in.
C: PHIL
D: What blizzard? A couple of flakes! An isolated phenomenon of nature.
C: PATROLMAN
D: Are you nuts? We got a major storm movin' in.
C: PHIL
D: No, no. All that moisture is going to miss us and hit Harrisburg.
C: PATROLMAN
D: Pal, you got that moisture on your head.
C: PHIL
D: But I have to get to Pittsburgh today!
C: PATROLMAN

Is it snowing in space?...But I have to call Pittsburgh...Isn't there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities?...Well, I'm both really. I'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through on that line?

C: NANCY
D: I don't think so. What part of the news do you do?

C: PHIL
D: Three bedrooms, two and a half baths. Looks much bigger than it , is. Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor. Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux, comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away. Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to Nancy .
C: PHIL
D: Good start. I ' m sure they'll be very happy. So what do you say? You want to play doggie obedience school with me?
N: -24-
C: NANCY
D: Thanks. I'll pass. She gets up to leave.

N: PHIL As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor. -25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed.

S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room. Something is wrong. He's wearing pajamas, his suit is once again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed. The song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come on with the same manic energy. Phil stares at the radio and listens to them. A look of astonishment comes over his face as they banter.
C: DEEJAY
D: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today!
C: SIDEKICK
D: It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.
C: PHIL
D: Nice going guys. That's yesterday's tape. Phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only half-listening to the radio.
E: to himself
N: -26-
C: DEEJAY
D: Not hardly. Expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing --
C: SIDEKICK
D: That "blizzard thing?" Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition of the broadcast.
C: SIDEKICK
D: Oh, here's the report: the National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing."
E: CONT.
C: DEEJAY
D: Yes they are, but there's another reason today is very special --
C: SIDEKICK

C: DEEJAY
D: -- on their chapped lips, right -- Do you think Phil's going to come out and see his shadow?

D: Morning.
C: CHUBBY MAN
D: Think it'll be an early Spring?
C: PHIL
D: Didn't we do this yesterday?

N: CHUBBY MAN (INTIMIDATED) I don't know what you mean. Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into his eyes.
C: PHIL
D: Don't mess with me, pork chop. What day is this?
N: CHUBBY MAN (TERRIFIED) Febr uary second--Groundhog Day! Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man.

C: PHIL
D: D i d I? I don't know--
E: completely confused

E:  as she pours
C: PHIL
D: Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs. Lancaster?
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Is that the Italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse?
C: PHIL
D: No, that's spaghetti. Never mind. He heads for the door, still in a daze.
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors?
N: PHIL (VAGUELY) I don't know. I don't think so. I'll tell you after I wake up. Phil exits.
T: CUT TO:
N: -29-
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY.
C: PHIL
D: Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's everybody going?
C: PASSERBY
D: To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day! The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open- mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if trying to clear it and starts off down the street.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.
C: NED RYERSON
D: Hey, Phil! Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.
E: O.C.
C: NED
D: Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.
C: NED
D: My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heck-fire remember you. Well?
C: PHIL
D: Ned Ryerson?
C: NED
D: Bing! First shot right out of the box. So how's it going, ol' buddy?
C: PHIL
D: To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m not feeling real well. Could you excuse me?
C: NED
D: Now it's funny you should mention your health 'cause you'll never guess what I do.
N: -30-
C: PHIL
D: Do you sell insurance, Ned?
E: very distressed and desperate to get away from this guy
C: NED
D: Bing again! You're sharp as a tack today. Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could use more -- who couldn't?" -- but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right?
C: PHIL
D: Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I can't talk to you right now. He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep, slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.
E: really annoyed now
N: NED (BRAYING) Hey, look .out for that first v step. It's a doozyi Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward Gobbler's Knob.

N: The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment. In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry, when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.
C: RITA
D: Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil! Over here! Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the Knob, gesturing for her to follow. Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair mussed.
C: RITA
D: Where ' ve you been?
N: -31-
C: PHIL
D: I've got to talk to you. I think I'm losing my mind.
E: nervous, sweat ing
N: . RITA I know you're losing it. What are you doing over here? The camera's over there.
C: PHIL
D: Slap me, Rita.
C: RITA
D: What is this?
N: PHIL (INSISTENT) Just slap me-- hard. She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.
C: PHIL
D: I said hardl
N: . . .. ... .RITA . I can't!
C: PHIL
D: Do it! Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.
C: PHIL
D: Better. Almost too hard, Rita.
E: his cheek smarting
C: RITA
D: Are you drunk?
C: PHIL
D: No, drunk is more fun. Can I be serious with you for a minute?
C: RITA
D: I don't know. Can you?
C: PHIL
D: Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m having a problem-- no, I may be having a problem.
C: RITA
D: What are you trying to say?
N: -32-
C: PHIL
D: I'm trying to say that if I was having a problem, just hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know that you're someone I could count on in a crisis.
N: RITA (WORRIED) What did you do last night? The crowd begins to hush.
C: LARRY
D: We better get started. We're going to miss it.
C: PHIL
D: Were not going to miss it. (indicating the other
C: REPORTERS)
D: They're going to miss it.
N: RITA (EMPHATIC) Phil. We've been out here for an hour. We're cold and tired. Let's just get this and get out of here.
C: PHIL
D: Okay, put it here.
C: RITA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: Put the camera here . Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all of the other cameras are set up .
C: RITA
D: Phil , there is no tomorrow on this one. It's Groundhog Day.
C: PHIL
D: We were in the wrong spot yesterday .
N: RITA (IRKED) W ha t? Yesterday? What are you talking about?
C: PHIL
D: Just trust me. Put the camera here .
N: -33- Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and gives up.
C: RITA
D: Larry! She charges off toward the cameras. In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to Phil. Larry hurriedly sets up the camera.
C: LARRY
D: You want me to roll tape?
C: RITA
D: Are you going to get on your mark?
E: to Phil
C: PHIL
D: No hurry. Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the mound.
N: LARRY (DESPERATELY) Everyone else is rolling! Rita looks helplessly at Phil.
C: RITA
D: I'm begging you, all right? Gould we please just do this? Phil glances down at his watch.
C: PHIL
D: Okay, let's do it. He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder.
C: PHIL
D: Roll tape.
N: LARRY (MUMBLING) Prima donnas. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence.
C: LARRY
D: Rolling.
N: -34- Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this time it's a bit tentative.
C: PHIL
D: We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again-- and you know what that means. Everybody's here on Gobbler's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect. The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door, then opens it and retreats. Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental prediction, recalling the previous day.
E: to camera
C: PHIL
D: My forecast is we're going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then he's going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the ground.
C: RITA
D: That's it. I'm going to kill him. Phil looks at his watch.
E: whispers to Larry
C: PHIL
D: O k ay ? And here we go-- Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right, steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool, directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole. Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil. Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog burrow.
N: -35- RITA (HISSES) Phil! Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.
C: BUSTER
D: He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment. Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.
C: RITA
D: For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney. She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her finger across her throat.
E: at a loss

D: Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call.
C: PHIL
D: I know there's a blizzard, but I have to get a call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a medical emergency. . . .No, don't give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department. When do you think the long distance lines will be working again?. . . But what if we don't have a tomorrow? We didn't have one today, my friend... Hello...Hello? He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and retreats back under the covers.
E: on the phone

N: -36- CLOSE UP - CLOCK The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap.
C: DEEJAY
D: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today!
C: SIDEKICK
D: It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach? Phil rushes out of the room.

S: INT. BED AND BREAKFAST - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room.
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Painting something, Mr. Connors?
C: PHIL
D: I ' m conducting an experiment.
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - LATER
N: Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed. Out fall a couple of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools. He puts on the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing the door shut.
T: CUT TO:
N: -37-
S: EXT. CORRIDOR - LATER
N: Mrs. Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking very worried. Loud music is playing inside the room. From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering, wood splintering and glass breaking.
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished sink. Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the mirror with his sledgehammer. Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls, madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the room with it. As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open, then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of feathers. Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door. We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil sleeping on the bed. He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy as the day he checked in. He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved. The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word right along with them, shocked into a state of complete wonderment. -38-

For Channel 9 News, this is Phil Connors in Punxsutawney . He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.
E: mock laugh
C: PHIL

C: RITA
D: Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the punchline.
E: completely skeptical
C: PHIL
D: No, really. It's like today never happened. I shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They'd grow back. Just like a starfish. I probably don't even have to floss?
C: RITA
D: I'm wracking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this.
C: PHIL
D: 'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm asking for your help. Rita looks at him for a long moment.

C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Sort of, I guess. Abnormal Psychology.

D: So based on that what would you say?
N: PSYCHOLOGIST (HESITANT) I ' d say that maybe you're -- I don't know -- a little delusional.

D: Then how do I know this conversation is really happening?

N: -45-
C: GUS
D: You mean like if the world was gonna end?
C: PHIL
D: No, I mean like if it was never going to end. If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldn't get out and nothing you did mattered?

C: RALPH
D: Thanks , man .
C: PHIL
D: It's nothing. Get in. They all pile into the front seat with Phil at the wheel.
C: PHIL
D: Seatbelts. Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts. Suddenly, Phil floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car as he screeches around the corner.
E: starting the ear
S: INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS

N: Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and a STOP sign and bounces back onto the street. A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and takes off after him.

C: GUS
D: Hey, Phil? How're we going to get out of this?
N: THEIR POV - THE INTERSECTION AHEAD Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways, completely blocking the road. Officers stand in the roadway, motioning for Phil to stop. PHIL (CALMLY) Gus, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with terror. The police dive out of the way.
C: PHIL AND RALPH
D: Yahooooo!
N: THEIR POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars. BLACK OUT: C LOSE UP - CLOCK The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing "I Got You, Babe." Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the same as before. He hops out of bed and quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The music ends and the two deej ays come on.
C: DEEJAY
D: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today. Phil talks out loud along with them.
C: PHIL AND SIDEKICK
D: It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach?
N: -49- The deejays laughs. Phil laughs, too, exhilirated at having survived the car wreck, still very confused and perplexed, but just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique situation. He starts dressing in a hurry.

N: PHIL (URGENTLY) Yes, I would like some coffee; the weather is going to be cold and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today; and yes, I will be staying an extra day. MRS. LANCASTER (BAFFLED) Why thank you.
C: PHIL
D: Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been around here looking for me this morning? Maybe a state official, blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick, badge, driving a late-model Ford br Chevy, black and white with bub ble lights on top--
N: MRS. LANCASTER (SHOCKED) No, no one like that-- I .don't-- Will they be?

E: O.C.
C: NED
D: Phil! Phil Connors!
C: PHIL
D: Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head! Before Ned can say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking. Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before. A PEDESTRIAN walking behind him steps right into it.

S: EXT . GOBBLER'S KNOB - LATER
N: Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area when he notices NANCY, the girl he met at the hotel bar, and stops to talk to her.

N: Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc. Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry.
C: RITA
D: Is this some new fad diet? Don't you worry about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair.
N: -52-
C: PHIL
D: I don't worry about anything anymore.
C: RITA
D: What makes you so special? Everybody worries about something.

D: Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.
C: RITA
D: You really do have a death wish, don't you?
C: PHIL
D: Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish. I'm just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild?
N: -53-
C: RITA
D: I wouldn't even know what it means to go wild.
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, well, that's where I come in. Going wild is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car.
N: RITA (DISBELIEVING) Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning.
C: PHIL
D: That's my point. I know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit. Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom.
C: RITA
D: And how. . , do we manage that?
C: PHIL
D: You leave that to me. Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them.

N: NANCY (COLD) Who's Rita? PHIL (CAUGHT) No one. It's just something I say when I make love. You know -- "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like "Oh, baby" or something.
C: NANCY

A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl, LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French maid.

N: We pan down the line of ROUGH TRADE PATRONS to. Phil, dressed all in black leathers, both arms heavily tattooed, looking like Sid Viscious on crack. He takes off his hat to reveal red, white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of mystery pills into his mouth. Phil washes them down with a shot and a beer.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: It looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's "Satyricon." Heavy metal is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door, shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes against the door. Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand.
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, but eventually you' d just get tired of screwing around and then you'd want a real relationship, wouldn't you?
E: more to himself than to Angie
C: ANGIE
D: I don't know. A big German Shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them.

D: Get down, Brunoi
N: (CONTINUING) Someone decent, someone who you respected, who respects you. -60-
C: ANGIE
D: I guess so. The dog jumps up again.

Rita and Phil both get into it, packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends. A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up.

D: You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect.

With the radio off, Phil does the deejays' morning routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time. PHIL (DULLY) Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's cooooold out there today. Phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously fatigued. -72-

With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they hated the winter so damned much, why don't they move to Florida, anyway? -74- Larry and Rita look on, incredulous.

I can't stand this street and I can't stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the "quaint" little shops and most of all, I can't stand anything-- ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on it.

He pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket, lights it, and throws it into the hole, then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits the deck. He lifts his rifle and aims it. Smoke is now pouring from the mound. Lots of it. Phil waits, his trigger finger twitching. A WOMAN casually walks by, stops. She surveys the situation.

N: Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman, reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads: "Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates" Phil heads right for it. The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger. As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip. The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes. Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the case.
C: PHIL'S POV
D: The groundhog looks right into his sights. Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT. The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The groundhog looks up playfully. Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and wrestle him to floor. The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.
C: BYSTANDER

Rita watches him, then follows at a discreet distance, very worried. In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow, Buster Greene and TWO other GROUNDHOG CLUB OFFICIALS are lifting a cage into the front seat of Buster's pickup.

C: RITA
D: I don't know. I don't know how else you could know so much. Maybe it is really happening.
N: -92-
C: PHIL
D: I used to try to stay up all night sometimes. I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going on, or at least hang onto something from the day before. But I gave up on that a long time ago. Rita looks at him with compassion.
C: RITA
D: It sounds so-- lonely.
C: PHIL
D: (trying to shrug it
C: OFF)
D: It's not that bad. You get used to it. Rita comes to a decision.
C: RITA
D: Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with you-- as an objective witness. Just to see what happens. Okay?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, sure. That'd be okay.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: A hat is lying on Phil's bed. A playing card flies past. A second playing card sails right into the hat. Another playing card sails past, missing. Another playing card sails right in Phil and Rita are tossing cards. Rita is missing. Phil is hitting.
C: PHIL
D: It's not in the wrist so much as the fingers. Be the hat.
C: RITA
D: It would take me a year to get good at this.
C: PHIL
D: Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five hours a day.
C: RITA
D: Is this what you do with eternity?
N: -93-
C: PHIL
D: Now you know. It's like waiting for a bus that never comes . You should see me play pool -- and bowling, juggling, hacky sack. I can ride a unicycle. There ' s a knock on the door .
C: PHIL
D: I'll get it! Phil jumps for the door and opens it. The PIZZA GUY is there.
C: PHIL
D: Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the delivery charge, right?

C: RITA
D: (taking a bite of
C: PIZZA)
D: I don ' t think I ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen. I like to be surprised.
C: PHIL
D: That's not the worst part.
C: RITA
D: What's the worst part?
C: PHIL
D: The worst part is starting over everyday. Tomorrow you won't remember any of this. You'll go back to treating me like a complete jerk --
C: RITA
D: No --
C: PHIL
D: It's not your fault. I am a jerk.
N: -94-
C: RITA
D: No, you're not.
C: PHIL
D: Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't make a lot of difference. I've killed myself so many times, I don't even exist anymore. I'm just completely empty.
C: RITA
D: Or completely clean.
C: PHIL
D: If you're going to be this positive all the time I may have to rough you up a little.
C: RITA
D: Wait! Have we done this before?
C: PHIL
D: Which part?
C: RITA
D: You getting me up here, the card gam e, the pizza--
C: PHIL
D: No, this is the first time.
N: RITA (EXCITED) Well?
C: PHIL
D: Well, what?
C: RITA
D: Well how does it feel to be doing something completely new? Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.
C: PHIL
D: Good. Really good. He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE PIZZA BOX - LATER There's only one slice left. Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not touching. Soft music is playing on the radio. -95-
C: RITA
D: Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes. One to be a great journalist. One to, I don't know, go back to school, study art, or auto mechanics. One just to take care of all the busywork, you know, pay the bills, get my car tuned up. One to be the wild woman of Borneo. One to be Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not a curse, Phil. It all just depends on how you look at it. Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. Then he belches really loud. Rita stares at him, then burps surprisingly loud herself.
C: RITA
D: I want you to know, it's been a really nice day for me.
C: PHIL
D: Me, too.
C: RITA
D: Maybe, if it's not too boring for you, we could do it again.
C: PHIL
D: I hope so. The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs Phil's hand. He puts his arm around her. They look into each others' eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring smile. She squeezes his hand. Their eyes turn to the clock. 11:;59 turns to 12:00. Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event.
C: RITA
D: You're still here!
C: PHIL
D: I know.
C: RITA
D: I thought you were supposed to disappear-- or I was or something.
C: PHIL
D: Not 'til six.
C: RITA
D: You rat!
N: -96- She is mad in a playful way.
C: PHIL
D: I never said midnight--
C: RITA
D: You knew I was waiting for midnight!
C: PHIL
D: But I never said it.
C: RITA
D: Oh, I can't believe you! (she slugs him with a
C: PILLOW)
D: I didn't know this was going to take all night!
C: PHIL
D: Does that mean you're going?
C: RITA
D: No. Phil takes Rita's hand. She doesn't resist.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: LATER
D: Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head resting on his shoulder. She nods off then catches herself.
C: RITA
D: I'm sorry.
C: PHIL
D: It's okay to go to sleep you know. I promise I won't touch you-- much.
C: RITA
D: No, it's all right. I'm not tired. What were you saying? Her eyes start to close again.
C: PHIL
D: I was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it's rightful owner.
C: RITA
D: Really?
E: drifting off
N: -97-
C: PHIL
D: That's right. He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to her.
C: PHIL
D: What I was going to say was, I think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl I ever met in my life. She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.
C: PHIL
D: Shhhh. That's good. (satisfied she's still
C: ASLEEP)
D: I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever. iEverytime I -saw you around the station, I thought my heart was going to explode. I used to dream about us being together. In my dream you loved me as much as I loved you and we didn't have to say anything but I knew you understood everything. She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep sleep.
C: PHIL
D: I know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you, but if I did, I swear I would love you for the rest of my life. Rita opens her eyes.
N: RITA (HALF-ASLEEP) Did you say something?
C: PHIL
D: Good-night, Rita. He kisses her gently on the forehead.
C: RITA
D: Good-night, Phil.
N: -98- C LOSE UP - THE CLOCK The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing. Phil wakes up alone in bed. He lies there for a moment then leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the shower.

C: RITA
D: Really?

D: I mean, maybe we should go for it. What do you think?
C: RITA
D: Sounds good to me. Larry?
C: LARRY

C: RITA
D: All right. Thanks, Phil. Good work. She reaches for an equipment case.
C: PHIL
D: I'll get that. Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear.

D: I ' d like a piano lesson, please.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN
N: Phil stands in front of the camera, giving his report.
C: PHIL
D: In fact, the groundhog's legendary ability to predict the weather may be more than just the German folklore of the region. Higher temperatures trigger hormonal changes in the testosterone levels of male groundhogs, which may in fact wake them from hibernation and send them out to battle with other males ;for mating rights. So, the truth is they're not looking for their shadows, they're looking for groundhog chicks. Rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report.
T: CUT TO:

C: PHIL
D: Groundhog Day, February second, also known as Candlemas Day or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, the day Mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings following the birth of the infant Jesus, and celebrated since the Middle Ages by the sacramental lighting of candles. Hence the old Scottish couplet which long predates the .American groundhog tradition: "If Candlemas dawns bright and clear, there'll be two winters in the year." Larry whispers an aside to Rita.
C: LARRY
D: Is he making this stuff up?
N: RITA (RIVETED) Shhhhh.

N: Beyond the graveyard is a work shed with various tombstones scattered about. Old TUCKER, the town stonecarver, is at work chiseling a name into a gravemarker. Behind him, Phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble, sculpting a very lovely cherub. Rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea watching him with amazed interest.
C: PHIL
D: But what if the rules changed? What if none of your actions had consequences?
C: RITA
D: There would still be an absolute morality. There has to be an absolute good, regardless of the circumstances.
C: PHIL
D: Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then let me ask you this. Where does this "absolute good" come from? From the sky?
N: -103- Rita shrugs.
C: RITA
D: I don't know. From my freshman Philosophy course, I guess. They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long moment and grins.
C: PHIL
D: What?
C: RITA
D: Nothing. I just can't believe you're such a fine sculptor. Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.
C: PHIL
D: I gotta go.
C: RITA
D: Where do you have to go in Punxsutawney?
C: PHIL

C: PHIL
D: Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't believe it. I've missed you so much.
N: -104- Phil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the neck. Ned goes into homophobic shock.

N: Phil walks briskly toward an intersection, glancing nervously at his watch. Rita follows him at a distance, hurrying to keep up. MARIE, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat. She isn't paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck bearing down on her. As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly missing her.
C: PHIL
D: Hey! Did you forget to look both ways? You didn't even look one way.
C: MARIE
D: My doggie was cold.

Everyone falls silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears. Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.

N: It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita. She looks like an angel.
C: PHIL
D: Wait! Don't move!
N: Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously, joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.
C: RITA
D: Making a snow man? I'll help.
C: PHIL
D: No, stay there. Stand right th ere.
N: Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LATER Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.
C: RITA
D: Can I look?
C: PHIL
D: O kay, look.
N: It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage. RITA (OVERWHELMED) Nobody's ever done this for me. Not even a drawing. It's beautiful. -117-
C: PHIL
D: This is how I see you. When it all gets too much, I just close my eyes and there you are-- just like this. Take it home and keep it in the freezer. Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into each others eyes.
C: PHIL
D: This one's for the Frog Prince.
C: RITA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: Nothing. They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.
C: PHIL
D: Will you come with me? Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming each other in the cold night air.
C: RITA
D: (looks back at the ice
C: SCULPTURE)
D: We're just going to leave her?
C: PHIL
D: It doesn't matter. Really, it doesn't. They kiss again.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE UP - THE CLOCK The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence. No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing. Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep under the covers. PHIL (DISBELIEVING) It's not true. It's not. It can't be true. Rita? Rita! -118- RITA (STRETCHING
C: LUXURIOUSLY)
D: Mmmm. Morning. Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.
C: PHIL
D: You're here! My god! I can't believe you're here!
C: RITA
D: Glad to see you, too.
C: PHIL
D: No! It's happened. Don't you get it? It's tomorrow! It's -- Phil turns on the radio.
C: DEEJAY
D: . . . still shoveling put the highways, but if you're walking, it's a beautiful day.
C: S IDEKICK
D: Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt h in g up--
C: DEEJAY
D: --except your mouth. Phil kisses the radio.
C: PHIL
D: I love those guys.
C: RITA
D: Are you always this jolly in the morning? Phil runs to the window and looks out.
N: HIS POV - THE STREET The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids are throwing snowballs.
C: PHIL
D: No groundhog! Rita! They're all gone!
C: RITA
D: You must've had some dream. Phil stops, thinks.
N: -1 1 9 -
C: PHIL
D: Did I just dream it? Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only pajama bottoms.
C: RITA
D: Phi l? Phil! Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few bars.
C: PHIL
D: Yeah!!!! Phil runs back into the room.
E: O.C.
C: PHIL
D: It really happened! You're really here! He pounces on Rita again.
C: PHIL
D: You're really actually here.
N: RITA (LAUGHING) I'm here, I'm here! They kiss, passionately, hungrily.
C: PHIL
D: Let's go! He scoops her up in his arms.
C: RITA
D: Where're we going?
C: PHIL
D: Anywhere! Everywhere!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LATER
N: Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster Phil hugs her.
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: Oh, my!
N: -120-
C: PHIL
D: Florence! Say hello to Rita. She loves me.
C: MRS. LANCASTER
D: I'm not surprised. He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.
S: EXT. THE STREET - DAY
N: Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.
C: A MAN
D: Phil! Good morning!
C: A LADY
D: Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank you.
C: PHIL
D: That's all right. I-- A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.
C: FLORIST
D: Phil, here. I want you to have these.
C: PHIL
D: Thanks, Carl. Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.
C: PHIL
D: And so began my final lifetime, and ended the longest winter on record. I would find myself no longer able to affect the chain of events in this town, but I did learn something about time. You can waste time, you can kill time, you can do time, but if you use it wisely, there's never enough of it. So you'd better make the most of the time you've got. A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita and Phil continue their walk.
E: V.O.
N: -121-
C: PHIL
D: Larry never got through the blizzard, so none of my groundhog reports ever made it on the air. But Rita and I-- we lived happily ever after. Phil and Rita walk off together. Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.
E: V.O.
C: NED
D: But Phil told me you were his accountant!
C: LARRY
D: Look, I told you! He's nuts! Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.
C: NED
D: Let me just tell you about single premium life-- Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned floundering in a snowbank. Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside that embraces it.
N: THE END
