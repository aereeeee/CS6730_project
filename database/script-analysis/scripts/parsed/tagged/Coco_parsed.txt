D: Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born.
E: V.O.
N: A story begins to play out on the papel picado.
C: MIGUEL
D: See, a long time ago there was this family.
E: V.O.

E: V.O. beat beat
N: The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her mamá, hardened. She shuts the door.
C: MIGUEL
D: And the mamá...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! After banishing all music from her life...
E: V.O. beat
N: The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and records.
C: MIGUEL
D: She found a way to provide for her daughter... She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. She could have made candy!

E: V.O.
N: In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!
C: MIGUEL

E: V.O. beat
N: TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the OFRENDA ROOM - DAY where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his face has been torn away.
C: MIGUEL
D: She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on Día de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... And her little girl?
E: V.O. beat

C: MIGUEL
D: Holá, Mamá Coco.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: How are you, Julio?
C: MIGUEL
D: Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything.
E: V.O.
N: QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mamá Coco:
S: EXT. COURTYARD
C: MIGUEL

S: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM
N: Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.

C: ABUELITA
D: Miguel! Eat your food.
N: Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain. She gives Mamá Coco a kiss on the head.

E: V.O.
N: Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.
C: ABUELITA

D: I asked if you would like more tamales.
C: MIGUEL
D: S-sí?

C: ABUELITA
D: No music!
S: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM - DAY
N: Miguel listens as a truck drives by the window, blaring radio tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.

N: A trio of gentlemen serenade each other as they stroll by the family compound.
C: MUSICIANS
D: AUNQUE LA VIDA--

C: MIGUEL
D: I think we're the only family in México who hates music...
E: V.O
S: INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY

D: I am NOT like the rest of my family...
E: V.O.
N: He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.
C: WOMAN
D: Hola, Miguel!
C: MIGUEL
D: Hola!
N: He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes, the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm. Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce and tosses the vendor a coin.
C: MIGUEL
D: Muchas gracias!
C: STREET VENDOR
D: De nada, Miguel!
N: As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes. The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel, who laughs.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hey, hey! Dante!
N: Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.
C: MIGUEL
D: Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump.
N: Dante obeys to the best of his ability.
C: MIGUEL
D: Good boy, Dante!
N: Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples back into the trash can.
T: CUT TO:
N: MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the square with music.
C: MIGUEL

E: V.O beat
N: Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the heart of the plaza.

T: CUT TO:
N: CLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car...
C: MIGUEL
D: He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.
E: V.O.
N: MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull guitar with flourish and flair.
C: MIGUEL
D: He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly!
E: V.O.
N: A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat.
C: MIGUEL

C: MIGUEL
D: He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942...
E: V.O.
N: As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME!
N: De la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell.
C: MIGUEL
D: When he was crushed by a giant bell.

S: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY
C: MIGUEL
D: ...If it wasn't for my family.
E: CONT'D
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Ay, ay, ay, muchacho.
E: playful
C: MIGUEL
D: Huh?
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story.
N: Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh, yeah, sorry.
N: He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe. As Miguel shines, the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.
C: MIGUEL
D: I just can't really talk about any of this at home so...
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Look, if I were you I'd march right up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm a musician. Deal with it!"
C: MIGUEL
D: I could never say that...
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: You ARE a musician, no?
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself--
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his sweet, sweet skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud!
N: The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up for tonight. The music competition for Día de Muertos. You wanna be like your hero? You should sign up!
E: CONT'D
C: MIGUEL
D: Uh-uh, my family would freak!
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Look, if you're too scared, then, well... have fun making shoes.
N: Miguel considers this.
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: C'mon. What did de la Cruz always say?
E: CONT'D
C: MIGUEL
D: ...Seize your moment?
N: The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Show me what you got, muchacho. I'll be your first audience.
N: Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic. Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating his chord and...
C: ABUELITA
D: MIGUEL!
E: O.S.
N: Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward him. Miguel's TÍO BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow with supplies from the market.
C: MIGUEL
D: Abuelita!
C: ABUELITA
D: What are you doing here?
C: MIGUEL
D: Um...uh...
N: Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes. Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi. She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.
C: ABUELITA
D: You leave my grandson alone!
C: PLAZA MARIACHI
D: Doña, please -- I was just getting a shine!
C: ABUELITA
D: I know your tricks, mariachi! What did he say to you?
E: to Miguel
C: MIGUEL
D: He was just showing me his guitar...
N: Gasps from the family.
C: TÍO BERTO
D: Shame on you!
N: Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between his eyes.
C: ABUELITA
D: My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito -- he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him!
N: The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to her bosom.
C: ABUELITA
D: Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo?
N: She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the embrace. He gasps for air.
C: ABUELITA
D: You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now.
E: distressed
N: Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW", he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.
S: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel catches up to his family.
C: TÍO BERTO
D: How many times have we told you -- that plaza is crawling with mariachis!
C: MIGUEL
D: Yes, Tío Berto.
N: Dante ambles up to Miguel, sniffing and whining for a treat.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no, no!
N: Abuelita shoos him away.
C: ABUELITA
D: Go away, you! Go!
N: Dante darts off, scared.
C: MIGUEL
D: It's just Dante...
N: Abuelita throws her shoe at the dog.
C: ABUELITA
D: Never name a street dog. They'll follow you forever. Now, go get my shoe.
E: beat

S: INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP
N: The Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes. WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture.
C: ABUELITA
D: I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel...
E: disappointed
C: MAMÁ
D: You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.
C: MIGUEL
D: I was just shining shoes!
C: TÍO BERTO
D: A musician's shoes!
N: Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof.
C: MIGUEL
D: But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
C: PAPÁ
D: If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza.
C: MIGUEL
D: But what about tonight?
E: blurting
C: PAPÁ FRANCO
D: What's tonight?
C: MIGUEL
D: Well they're having this talent show-
N: Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious. Miguel squirms, deciding whether to go on.
C: MIGUEL
D: And I thought I might...
N: Mamá looks at Miguel, curious.
C: MAMÁ
D: ...Sign up?
C: MIGUEL
D: Well, maybe?
C: PRIMA ROSA
D: You have to have talent to be in a talent show.
E: laughing
C: PRIMO ABEL
D: What are YOU going to do, shine shoes?
N: The shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head.
C: ABUELITA
D: It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family.
N: She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms.
C: ABUELITA
D: Ofrenda room. Vámonos.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar.
C: ABUELITA
D: Don't give me that look. Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important! If we don't put them up, they can't come! We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where.
E: beat beat
N: She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away.
C: ABUELITA
D: Where are you going?
E: CONT'D
C: MIGUEL
D: I thought we were done...
C: ABUELITA
D: Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like--
N: Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician.
C: MIGUEL
D: Like Mamá Coco's papá?
C: ABUELITA
D: Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten.
C: MIGUEL
D: But you're the one who--
C: ABUELITA
D: Ta, ta, ta-tch!
C: MIGUEL
D: I was just--
C: ABUELITA
D: Tch-tch!

D: Papá?
N: They look to find Mamá Coco agitated.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá is home...?
E: CONT'D
C: ABUELITA
D: Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá is coming home?
C: ABUELITA
D: No Mamá. It's okay, I'm here.
N: Mamá Coco looks up at Abuelita.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Who are you?
N: Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.
C: ABUELITA
D: Rest, Mamá.
N: Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.
C: ABUELITA
D: I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel. Miguel... Miguel?
E: CONT'D beat
N: She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found. Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.
C: ABUELITA
D: What are we going to do with that boy...?
E: CONT'D sigh
N: She looks to the photo of Mamá Imelda. Abuelita's eyes brighten with an idea.
C: ABUELITA
D: You're right. That's just what he needs!
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SIDE STREET
N: Tío Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby, Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof. He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business and lifts it up.
S: INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT
N: Dante pokes his head in. Miguel turns and gasps.
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up.
N: Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.
C: MIGUEL
D: You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me!
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a beat up old soundboard and random other items. He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears to be his own version of a skull guitar head.
C: MIGUEL
D: I wish someone wanted to hear me...
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel tunes the guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: Other than you...
E: CONT'D
N: Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed- out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.
C: MIGUEL
D: Perfecto!
E: CONT'D
N: He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz holding his skull guitar. Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover. Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile. He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine. A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films plays out. A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:" DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) I have to sing. I have to play. The music, it's -- it's not just in me. It is me. Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom. More clips run in the background as Miguel plays: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) When life gets me down, I play my guitar. In a clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:" DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I must follow my heart! De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately. Miguel cringes. Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:" DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) You know that feeling? Like there's a song in the air and it's playing just for you... As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he repeats the melody on his own guitar. DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) (singing)
C: A FEELING SO CLOSE
D: YOU COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT I NEVER KNEW I COULD
C: WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
D: BUT IT'S TRUE...
N: As a good-natured priest in "NUESTRA IGLESIA:" DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) You must have faith, sister.
C: NUN
D: Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
E: FILM CLIP
N: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) He will listen... to MUSIC! (singing)
C: ONLY A SONG ONLY A SONG
D: HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE A HEART...
N: Miguel loses himself in the music. DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) Never underestimate the power of music... Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set. The clip jumps forward:
C: LOLA
D: But my father, he will never give his permission.
E: FILM CLIP
N: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) I am done asking permission. When you see your moment you mustn't let it pass you by, you must seize it! The tape ends with an interview clip.
C: INTERVIEWER
D: Señor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment?
E: FILM CLIP
N: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) I had to have faith in my dream. No one was going to hand it to me. It was up to me to reach for that dream, grab it tight, and make it come true.
C: MIGUEL
D: ...and make it come true.
N: The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel. He reaches for the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."
C: MIGUEL
D: No more hiding, Dante. I gotta seize my moment!
N: Dante wags his tail, panting happily.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me!
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET
N: Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to the family compound.
C: ABUELITA
D: Día de los Muertos has begun!
N: In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter marigold petals from their baskets.
C: MAMÁ
D: No, no, no, no, no.
N: Mamá corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to the front gate.
C: MAMÁ
D: We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come, and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda, sí?
E: CONT'D
N: As Mamá teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching his guitar. Suddenly Tío Berto and Papá round the corner carrying a small table from storage.
C: PAPÁ
D: Mamá, where should we put this table?
N: Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees them.
C: ABUELITA
D: In the courtyard, mijos.
C: PAPÁ
D: You want it down by the kitchen?
C: ABUELITA
D: Sí. Next to the other one.
S: INT. OFRENDA ROOM
N: Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mamá Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda table.
C: MIGUEL
D: Get under, get under!
C: ABUELITA
D: Miguel!
E: O.S.
N: Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda room darkened by three figures.
C: MIGUEL
D: Nothing!
N: His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him. A pit grows in his stomach; he's been caught.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá -- Papá, I--
E: CONT'D
N: Papá lifts his finger to silence his son.
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel... Your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea! We've all decided -- it's time you joined us in the workshop!
E: beat beat
N: Abuelita hands Papá a leather apron, which he hangs over Miguel's shoulders.
C: MIGUEL
D: What?!
C: PAPÁ
D: No more shining shoes -- you will be making them! Every day after school!
N: Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing. She squeezes his cheeks, full of pride.
C: ABUELITA
D: Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on Día de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud!
N: She gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda.
C: ABUELITA
D: You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria.
E: CONT'D
C: PAPÁ
D: And wingtips, like your Papá Julio--
N: Miguel crosses away from the ofrenda.
C: MIGUEL
D: But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
C: PAPÁ
D: Ah, Migue... You have your family here to guide you... You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...?
E: beat
C: MIGUEL
D: ...A shoemaker. Through and through.
N: Papá swells.
C: PAPÁ
D: That's my boy! Berto, break out the good stuff, I wanna make a toast!
E: calling out
N: Papá heads out of the room, Mamá follows. Last is Abuelita, who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves. With the family gone, Miguel deflates. Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his heart's content. Miguel is horrified!
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante! No, Dante, stop!
N: Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table shakes. The frame with Mamá Imelda's photo sways back and forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no, no, no, no! No...
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel picks up the old photo of Mamá Imelda, which unfolds to reveal another portion, hidden all these years; the man with no face is revealed to be holding a familiar skull-headed guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: De la Cruz's guitar...?
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá?
N: Miguel turns, startled. Mamá Coco points a crooked finger at the picture in his hand.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá?
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel's eyes go wide as the connection dawns on him. Could it possibly be true?
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto de la Cruz?
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá! Papá!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT
N: Miguel goes to his secret ofrenda, to the record album of Ernesto de la Cruz. He compares the guitar in the family photo with the guitar on the sleeve. An exact match!
C: MIGUEL
D: Ha, ha!
S: EXT. ROOFTOP
N: Miguel runs to the edge of the roof, overlooking the courtyard, photo in one hand, guitar in the other.
C: MIGUEL
D: Papá! Papá!
N: His parents stop, looking up at Miguel.
C: MIGUEL
D: It's him! I know who my great- great grandfather was!
E: CONT'D
C: MAMÁ
D: Miguel! Get down from there!
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
C: PAPÁ
D: What are you talking about?
N: Miguel whips off his shoemaker's apron, striking a pose with the guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm gonna be a musician!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING
N: Miguel's guitar is cast at his feet, along with his de la Cruz albums. The whole family encircles the boy.
C: ABUELITA
D: What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family?
C: TÍO BERTO
D: It's all that time he spends in the plaza...
C: TÍA GLORIA
D: ...Fills his head with crazy fantasies!
C: MIGUEL
D: It's not a fantasy!
N: Miguel hands Papá the photo and points to the skull guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time!
E: CONT'D
C: PAPÁ
D: We've never known anything about this man. But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family. This is no future for my son.
C: MIGUEL
D: But Papá, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music!
C: ABUELITA
D: Never! That man's music was a curse! I will not allow it!
C: MIGUEL
D: If you would just let--
C: MAMÁ
D: Miguel--
E: warning
C: PAPÁ
D: You will listen to your family. No more music.
C: MIGUEL
D: Just listen to me play--
C: PAPÁ
D: End of argument.
N: Miguel lifts his guitar to play when Abuelita snatches the instrument away. She points to the man in the photo.
C: ABUELITA
D: You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda?!
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda!
N: Gasps from the family. Abuelita's brow hardens. She lifts the guitar in the air.
C: MIGUEL
D: No!
C: PAPÁ
D: Mamá...
N: Abuelita smashes it to bits!
C: ABUELITA
D: There. No guitar, no music.
E: softening MORE
C: ABUELITA
D: Come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family.
E: CONT'D
N: She reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond repair.
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't wanna be in this family!
N: He snatches the photo from Papá and bolts out of the hacienda.
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel! MIGUEL!
S: EXT. SIDE STREET
N: Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away. Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."
S: EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING
N: Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo.
C: MIGUEL
D: I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
C: STAGE MANAGER
D: You got an instrument?
C: MIGUEL
D: No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
C: STAGE MANAGER
D: Musicians gotta bring their own instruments... You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list.
E: walking away
N: Miguel looks distraught. MOMENTS LATER: Miguel approaches any musician he can find.
C: MIGUEL
D: Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?
N: MUSICIAN #1 Sorry, muchacho.
T: CUT TO:
C: MIGUEL
D: You guys have a spare guitar?
N: MUSICIAN #2 No.
T: CUT TO:
C: MIGUEL
D: I need a guitar, just for a little bit--
N: MUSICIAN #3 Get outta here, kid! Disheartened, Miguel walks away. He finds himself facing the statue of de la Cruz.
C: MIGUEL
D: Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do?
N: No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
N: A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves. Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from one shadow to the next. Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel. He barks excitedly.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cállate! Shhh!
N: Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.
S: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
N: Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb. He looks in one of the windows. Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked. More fireworks shoot into the sky.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm sorry...
N: Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.
S: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
N: Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly moving the lid. He stifles a gasp. He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust, revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the portrait of de la Cruz.
C: MIGUEL
D: Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this.
N: Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount. Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum begin to sparkle.
C: MIGUEL
D: Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment!
E: CONT'D
N: He backs up, in full view of the painting.
C: MIGUEL
D: So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did!
E: CONT'D
N: Confidence building, he strums it once. The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave. The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just happened? Suddenly, a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum.
C: VOICES
D: The guitar! It's gone! Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar! The window's broken, look.
E: O.S.
N: Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking. A GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight.
C: GROUNDSKEEPER
D: Alright, who's in there?
N: Startled, Miguel puts down the guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my...
N: The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel! He doesn't even see him!
C: GROUNDSKEEPER
D: There's nobody here!
S: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
N: A panicked Miguel runs out, trying to figure out what's going on! But the people in the cemetery walk through him too. Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.
C: MAMÁ
D: Miguel!
N: Miguel turns to see Papá and Mamá still searching for him.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá!
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel! Come home!
N: He reaches for his parents, but goes straight through them.
C: PAPÁ
D: Where are you, Miguel?!
N: Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave. A nearby woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.
C: WOMAN
D: Dios mío! Little boy, are you okay?
N: She reaches into the grave.
C: WOMAN
D: Here, let me help you.
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel takes her hand and she pulls him out.
C: MIGUEL
D: Thanks, I--
N: They see each other face to face. The woman is a skeleton! Miguel screams! She does too! Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's hands.
C: SKELETON HEAD
D: Do you mind?
C: MIGUEL
D: Ahhh!
C: SKELETON HEAD
D: Ahhh!
C: MIGUEL
D: AHHH!
N: Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all see him! He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with their living families. One couple dances. Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which solidify in his hands when he takes them. A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler.
C: SKELETON ABUELA
D: Look how big she's getting!
N: Suddenly Dante surprises Miguel and licks him on the cheek. Miguel screams.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante?! You can see me? W-wait! What's going on?!
N: Dante barks, points, and bounds through the crowd.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante! Dante!
N: Miguel gives chase until -­ BAM! He runs smack into a mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Miguel?!
N: Miguel tries to gather the scattered bones.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: Miguel?
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: Miguel?
N: The bones magically pull away from Miguel.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: You're here! HERE here!
N: PAPÁ JULIO reconstitutes himself.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: And you can see us?!
E: CONT'D
N: TÍA ROSITA charges through Papá Julio, sending his bones scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!
N: Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for air.
C: MIGUEL
D: Remind me how I know you?
E: muffled
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: We're your family, mijo!
N: Tía Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory.
C: MIGUEL
D: Tía... Rosita?
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: Sí!
N: He looks at Papá Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong way. TÍA VICTORIA straightens it.
C: MIGUEL
D: Papá Julio?
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Hola.
C: MIGUEL
D: Tía Victoria?
N: Tía Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: He doesn't seem entirely dead.
N: A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: He's not quite alive either...
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know how to fix this!
N: Suddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family.
C: TÍO FELIPE
D: Oye!
E: huffing
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: It's Mamá Imelda--
E: winded
C: TÍO FELIPE
D: --She couldn't cross over!
E: huffing
N: The others gasp.
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: She's stuck--
C: TÍO FELIPE
D: --On the other side!
N: Miguel sees pictures of his Tío Oscar and Tío Felipe flash in his memory.
C: MIGUEL
D: Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: Oh, hey Miguel.
N: Tía Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel.
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: I have a feeling this has something to do with you.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us...
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: ...Then we are going to her! Vámonos!
N: Papá Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes through the cemetery, trailed by Dante.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a corner. His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before them.
C: MIGUEL
D: Whoa...
N: The bridge extends into the mist. A stream of skeletons amble across for the holiday. The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel hesitates at the threshold.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Come on, Miguel. It's ok.
N: Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his feet. Dante takes off.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante! Dante! Dante, wait up!
N: Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes some petals into Miguel's face.
C: MIGUEL
D: You gotta stay with me, boy. We don't know... where...
E: CONT'D
N: Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.
C: MIGUEL
D: This isn't a dream, then. You're all really out there...
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: You thought we weren't?
C: MIGUEL
D: Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins.
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.
C: MIGUEL
D: Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be...
N: As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing at him.
C: SKELETON MOTHER
D: Mija, it's not nice to stare at-- Ay! Santa Maria!
E: seeing Miguel
N: The woman goes wide-eyed, her head turning backwards to gawk at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel puts up his hood. The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.
C: MIGUEL
D: Are those...? Alebrijes! But those are--
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: REAL alebrijes. Spirit creatures...
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: They guide souls on their journey...
C: TÍO FELIPE
D: Watch your step, they make caquitas everywhere.
N: They get to the far edge of the Marigold Bridge.
S: EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
C: CANNED LOOP
D: Welcome back to the Land of the Dead. Please have all offerings ready for re-entry. We hope you enjoyed your holiday!
E: V.O.
N: A sign reads RE-ENTRY.
C: ARRIVALS AGENT
D: Welcome back! Anything to declare?
C: TRAVELER
D: Some churros... from my family.
C: ARRIVALS AGENT
D: How wonderful! Next!
C: CANNED LOOP
D: ...If you are experiencing travel issues, agents at the Department of Family Reunions are available to assist you.
E: V.O.
N: Miguel and family get into the line for RE-ENTRY, along with other skeletons returning from the Land of the Living. Nearby, skeletons exit the Land of the Dead through a gate marked DEPARTURES. Miguel watches.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Next family, please!
N: An ELDERLY COUPLE steps in front of a camera-mounted monitor. The monitor scans their faces and returns an image of their photos on an altar in the Land of the Living.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Oh, your photos are on your son's ofrenda. Have a great visit!
E: CONT'D
C: ELDERLY COUPLE
D: Gracias.
N: The couple unites with the rest of their family. They all step onto the bridge, which begins to glow as they gain footing.
C: CANNED LOOP
D: ...And remember to return before sunrise. Enjoy your visit!
E: V.O.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Next!
N: A skeleton man, a smile full of braces, steps up to the monitor.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit!
E: CONT'D
C: JUAN ORTODONCIA
D: Grashiash!
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Next!
N: HÉCTOR (early 20s), a ragged fellow, steps up to the monitor, disguised as Frida Kahlo.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie...
E: beat
N: The monitor scans him, but an "X" appears, accompanied by a negative buzzing sound.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: Well shoot. Looks like no one put up your photo, Frida...
N: Héctor peels off his unibrow and throws off his frock.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that.
C: DEPARTURES AGENT
D: No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone.
N: Héctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the gate. Héctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half going over, half under.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ha HA!
N: Héctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't engage; he sinks right into the petals.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Almost there, just a little further...!
N: The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull Héctor back toward the Land of the Dead.
C: OFFICER
D: Upsy-daisy...
C: HÉCTOR
D: Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge!
N: Miguel watches as the guards haul him out. Tía Rosita looks up in time to see his back.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.
C: ARRIVALS AGENT
D: Next!
E: O.S.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: Oh! Come mijo, it's our turn.
N: The arrivals line moves forward. The Dead Riveras crowd around the gate. The arrivals agent leans out from his window.
C: ARRIVALS AGENT
D: Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare?
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: As a matter of fact, yes.
N: The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hola.
N: The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
N: Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across an arching second floor walkway.
C: VOICE OVER P.A.
D: Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta Gonzales-Ramos, please report to Level 7.
N: Dante happily trots alongside. Miguel looks up to see gondolas traveling by.
C: MIGUEL
D: Whoa...
N: Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation.
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: I miss my nose...
N: At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with "DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS." The family passes through.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS
N: Inside, they find case workers helping travelers work out holiday snafus.
C: DISTRESSED TRAVELER
D: C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight...
T: CUT TO:
C: MIFFED WIFE
D: We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos!
T: CUT TO:
N: In a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I demand to speak to the person in charge!
N: A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mamá Imelda tears into her.
C: CASE WORKER
D: I'm sorry, señora, it says here no one put up your photo--
N: Mamá Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's desk.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies!
N: In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks the computer.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Mamá Imelda?
N: She turns her shoe on Papá Julio, who leans back and yelps. Mamá Imelda softens.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Well, we never made it to the ofrenda...
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: What?!
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: We ran into... um...
N: Mamá Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel. Miguel looks at Mamá Imelda. Her photo flashes before him.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel?
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Imelda...
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: What is going on?
N: Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out.
C: CLERK
D: You the Rivera family?
N: The computer short circuits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CLERK'S OFFICE
C: CLERK
D: Well, you're cursed.
N: The family gasps.
C: MIGUEL
D: What?!
N: The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers.
C: CLERK
D: Día de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead.
C: MIGUEL
D: But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Guitar...?
C: MIGUEL
D: It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it--
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that... ...musician! He is DEAD to this family!
E: disgust
C: MIGUEL
D: Uh, you're all dead.
N: Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and tries to reach a plate of food.
C: CLERK
D: ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije is that?
N: Miguel steps up, trying to pull Dante away from the treats.
C: MIGUEL
D: That's just Dante.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.
N: Tía Rosita gestures to the fantastical creatures fluttering on the other side of the window.
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: He just looks like a plain old dog...
C: TÍO FELIPE
D: ...Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.
C: CLERK
D: Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! -- terribly allergic.
C: MIGUEL
D: But Dante doesn't have any hair.
C: CLERK
D: And I don't have a nose, and yet here we are -- ACHOO!!
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.
N: Miguel realizes something. He sheepishly pulls out the folded photo.
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh...
N: He unfolds the photo.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
C: MIGUEL
D: It was an accident!
N: Mamá Imelda turns to the clerk, fire in her eyes.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: How do we send him back?!
C: CLERK
D: Well, since it's a family matter... The way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing.
E: flipping pages
C: MIGUEL
D: That's it?
C: CLERK
D: Get your family's blessing, and everything SHOULD go back to normal. But you gotta do it by sunrise!
C: MIGUEL
D: What happens at sunrise?
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Híjole! Your hand!
N: Miguel looks at his hand. The tip of one of his fingers has started to turn skeletal. He turns pale. He starts to faint when Papá Julio picks him up and gently slaps him awake.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you fainting on us.
C: CLERK
D: But not to worry! Your family's here, you can get your blessing right now.
N: The clerk searches the ground near Tía Rosita.
C: CLERK
D: Cempasúchil, cempasúchil. Aha! Perdón, señora.
N: Tía Rosita titters. The clerk plucks a marigold petal from the hem of her dress. He hands the petal to Mamá Imelda.
C: CLERK
D: Now, you look at the living and say his name.
E: to Imelda
N: Imelda turns to Miguel.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel.
C: CLERK
D: Nailed it. Now say: I give you my blessing.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I give you my blessing.
N: The marigold petal glows in her fingers. Miguel brightens. But Mamá Imelda is not finished.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I give you my blessing to go home...
E: CONT'D
N: The glow of the marigold petal surges.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: To put my photo back on the ofrenda...
E: CONT'D
N: Each added condition makes the petal glow brighter. Imelda delivers it like a scolding, but Miguel nods.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: And to never play music again!
E: CONT'D
N: The petal surges one last time.
C: MIGUEL
D: What? She can't do that!
C: CLERK
D: Well technically she can add any conditions she wants.
N: Miguel stares her down. Imelda is firm in her resolve.
C: MIGUEL
D: Fine.
C: CLERK
D: Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
E: to Imelda
N: Imelda extends the petal to Miguel, who reaches for it. He grabs the petal. WHOOOOSH! He's consumed by a whirlwind of petals and disappears. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT He reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's solid. He runs to the window and looks out.
C: MIGUEL
D: No skeletons!
N: Miguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar. Miguel quickly grabs the guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mariachi Plaza, here I come--
N: He takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH! CLERK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME Miguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family turns, shocked to see him back so soon. Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding position.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Two seconds and you already break your promise!
C: MIGUEL
D: This isn't fair, it's my life! You already had yours!
N: Miguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Papá Julio.
C: MIGUEL
D: Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing.
N: Papá Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down.
C: MIGUEL
D: Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tía Victoria?
E: CONT'D
N: They all shake their heads.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Don't make this hard, mijo. You go home my way, or no way.
C: MIGUEL
D: You really hate music that much?
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I will not let you go down the same path he did.
N: Miguel gets an idea. He pulls the photo out and turns from the group.
C: MIGUEL
D: The same path he did.
N: He gazes at the man with no face.
C: MIGUEL
D: He's family...
E: CONT'D to himself
C: TÍA VICTORIA
D: Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: She's just looking out for you.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: Be reasonable.
N: Miguel starts back toward the door.
C: MIGUEL
D: Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back!
N: Miguel sees himself out. The family waits for a beat.
C: CLERK
D: Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?
S: INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. Tío Oscar asks a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie. Miguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door exit.
C: MIGUEL
D: Vámonos.
N: Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole, and heads out. Dante pads after him.
C: PATROLWOMAN
D: We got a family looking for a LIVING BOY.
C: MIGUEL
D: If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa.
N: The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN.
C: PATROLMAN
D: Hold it, muchacho.
N: Miguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face.
C: PATROLMAN
D: Ahh!
N: The patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie.
C: PATROLMAN
D: I've found that living boy!
N: A large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty, arms full of offerings.
C: PATROLMAN
D: Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me folks! Excuse me--
N: Once the family clears, Miguel is nowhere to be seen.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEARBY CORRIDOR
N: Miguel and Dante hide from the patrolman. But Dante wanders off to inspect a side room.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no -- Dante!
S: INT. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
N: Miguel catches up to Dante. He overhears an exchange in a nearby cubicle.
C: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
D: ...disturbing the peace, fleeing an officer, falsifying a unibrow...
C: HÉCTOR
D: That's illegal?
C: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
D: VERY illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Amigo? Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... I've just had a really hard Día de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now.
E: verklempt misty
N: Héctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with mock emotion.
C: HÉCTOR
D: And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while.
E: CONT'D
N: Héctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's workstation.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show!
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel perks at the mention of de la Cruz.
C: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
D: Uh--
C: HÉCTOR
D: I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! You just gotta let me cross that bridge!
E: beat
N: The corrections officer pulls away.
C: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
D: I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday... But my shift's almost up, and I wanna visit my living family... so I'm letting you off with a warning.
E: beat
C: HÉCTOR
D: Can I at least get my costume back?
C: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
D: Uh, no.
N: In a huff, Héctor marches out of the room.

N: Miguel follows him.
S: INT. HALLWAY

S: INT. PHONEBOOTH
N: Miguel pulls Héctor into a phone booth to avoid suspicion.
C: MIGUEL
D: Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing.
E: CONT'D
C: HÉCTOR
D: That's weirdly specific.
C: MIGUEL
D: He's my great-great-grandfather.
C: HÉCTOR
D: He's your wha-whaat...?
N: Hector's eyes drop into his mouth. He pops them back up with a punch to his jaw. Miguel is a little grossed out. Héctor turns to conference with himself.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?!
E: CONT'D gasp beat

N: Héctor snaps his fingers rapidly, pistons firing.
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, niño, niño, niño, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME.
N: Miguel suddenly spies his family hurrying down a staircase. Mamá Imelda spots Miguel.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel!
C: MIGUEL
D: AH!
N: Héctor extends his hand.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I'm Héctor.
C: MIGUEL
D: That's nice!
N: Miguel grabs Héctor by the wrist and drags him to the exit, away from his family.
S: EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
N: Miguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs. Héctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel realizes it's no longer attached to Héctor's body. The arm signals backwards to Héctor who is ten paces behind.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Espérame chamaco!
N: Miguel throws the arm back to Héctor an they disappear into a dense crowd. Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving doors. Mamá Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's nowhere to be found.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita.
N: Mamá Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle. FWOOOMP! A giant winged jaguar lands in front of Mamá Imelda. She turns to the family.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Who has that petal Miguel touched?
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Here!
N: Papá Julio steps forward with a marigold petal. He creeps forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Nice alebrije...
N: Pepita sniffs the petal's scent. Suddenly Pepita's head darts, narrowing in on the scent. She takes to the air.
S: EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Miguel sits on a wooden crate. Héctor uses his thumb to smudge black and white shoe polish on the boy's face.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey, hey, hold still. Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!
E: beat
N: Héctor opens a small mirror. Miguel's face is painted to look like a skeleton.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos. Unless you're me.
E: CONT'D beat beat
C: MIGUEL
D: You don't get to cross over.

C: MIGUEL
D: This is you?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Muy guapo, eh?
C: MIGUEL
D: So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible?
E: beat upbeat
C: MIGUEL
D: Mmm, nope.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You gotta have SOME other family.
C: MIGUEL
D: ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.
N: Miguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to follow.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...!
T: CUT TO:

N: Miguel slink-walks next to Héctor goofily.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, skeletons don't walk like that.
C: MIGUEL
D: It's how you walk.
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, I don't.
N: Miguel keeps walking funny.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Stop it!
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel notices a billboard advertising "ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S SUNRISE SPECTACULAR!;" "Remember Me" blares from attached speakers.
C: MIGUEL
D: Whoa..."Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!" Qué padre!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Día de Muertos.
C: MIGUEL
D: And you can get us in!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ahhhh--
C: MIGUEL
D: Hey, you said you had front row tickets!
C: HÉCTOR
D: That... that was a lie. I apologize for that.
N: Miguel gives Héctor a withering look.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him.
C: MIGUEL
D: How?
C: HÉCTOR
D: 'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE, BENEATH WINDOWS
N: Héctor uses his suspenders to slingshot his arm to a third floor window. The hand taps on it.
S: INT. COSTUME ROOM
N: CECILIA, a costumer, turns from a costume to look at the window. Héctor's hand waves. She rolls her eyes and goes to open the window.
C: CECILIA
D: You better have my dress, Héctor!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hola, Ceci!
S: EXT. BENEATH WINDOW
N: She lowers a ladder so Héctor, Miguel and Dante can climb up. Héctor grabs his arm and reattaches it.
S: INT. COSTUME ROOM
N: They all crawl in through the window.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hola.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ceci, I lost the dress--
C: CECILIA
D: Ya lo sabía! I gotta dress forty dancers by sunrise and thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci...
N: As Héctor tries to talk her down, Dante wanders away from the costume area.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante... Dante!
N: Miguel chases after him.
S: INT. REHEARSAL AREA
C: MIGUEL
D: We shouldn't be in here...
N: Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into different artists workspaces. He passes papier-mâché sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing nude for a painter... Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him. Miguel hustles after him.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no, Dante! Ven acá!
N: The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage. Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.
C: FRIDA
D: You! How did you get in here?
C: MIGUEL
D: I just followed my--
N: Frida's eyes go wide when she sees Dante. She kneels and takes his head in her hands.
C: FRIDA
D: Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider of wandering spirits...! And whose spirit have you guided to me?
E: beat
N: Frida takes a closer look at Miguel.
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't think he's a spirit guide.
C: FRIDA
D: Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this world can take many forms... They are as mysterious as they are powerful...
N: The patterns on Frida's monkey swirl and he opens his mouth to breath a blue fire. He fumbles at the end with a chesty cough. Then they look to Dante, who is chewing his own leg. Suddenly, Frida turns back to Miguel.
C: FRIDA
D: Or maybe he's just a dog. Come! I need your eyes!
E: CONT'D
N: Frida guides him to view the rehearsal space.
C: FRIDA
D: You are the audience. Darkness. And from the darkness... A giant PAPAYA!
E: beat
N: Lights come up on a giant papaya prop.
C: FRIDA
D: Dancers emerge from the papaya and the dancers are all me!
N: Leotarded, unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the mesh papaya. Behind the papaya is an even larger half- finished mesh structure.
C: FRIDA
D: And they go to drink from the milk of their mother who is a cactus, but who is also me. And her milk is not milk but tears. Is it too obvious?
E: CONT'D to Miguel
C: MIGUEL
D: I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk...
E: beat
N: Frida, inspired, cues some musicians who start playing the tune.
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh! And then it could go dittle- ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle- dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!
E: CONT'D
N: The violins follow; a trombone punctuates.
C: FRIDA
D: And... what if everything was on fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!
N: The dancers gasp and look at each other, now concerned.
C: FRIDA
D: Inspired! You... you have the spirit of an artist!
E: leaning in
N: Miguel brightens. Frida turns back to the rehearsal.
C: FRIDA
D: The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!
N: A silhouette rises from a trap door. Miguel leans forward. A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a mannequin.
C: MIGUEL
D: Huh?
C: FRIDA
D: He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers--
N: Miguel hustles up to Frida.
C: MIGUEL
D: Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?
C: FRIDA
D: Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.
N: She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in the distance, atop a steep hill. Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner, out of breath.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities...
N: Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled.
C: MIGUEL
D: You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party.
C: HÉCTOR
D: That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
C: MIGUEL
D: If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?
C: HÉCTOR
D: He's YOUR great-great grandpa. How come he didn't invite YOU?
N: Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party?
C: GUSTAVO
D: It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo...
C: MUSICIANS
D: Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ha ha, very funny guys. Very funny.
C: MIGUEL
D: Chorizo?
C: GUSTAVO
D: Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died!
E: to Miguel, re: Héctor
N: Miguel looks to Héctor, eyebrow cocked.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I don't want to talk about it.
C: GUSTAVO
D: He choked on some CHORIZO!
N: The musicians laugh. Miguel tries to stifle a giggle.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference!
N: More laughter.
C: HÉCTOR
D: This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks!
E: to Miguel
C: MIGUEL
D: Hey, I'm a musician.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You are?
C: GUSTAVO
D: Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party...
N: Miguel's wheels start turning.
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think--
N: Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal transformation.
C: MIGUEL
D: I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing.
N: Miguel looks up to Héctor.
C: MIGUEL
D: You know where I can get a guitar?
E: CONT'D
N: Héctor sighs.

D: I know a guy...

S: EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner. She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light. She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face, finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl. The Dead Riveras follow after her.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy?
N: Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint. It glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.
C: TÍA ROSITA
D: A footprint!
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: It's a Rivera boot!
C: TÍO OSCAR
D: Size seven...
C: TÍO FELIPE

S: EXT. NARROW STAIRWAY
N: Miguel follows Héctor down a steep stairway. Miguel looks to his bony knuckles, concern on his face.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?
C: MIGUEL
D: My great-great grandpa was a musician.
C: HÉCTOR
D: ...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, guácala, no...
C: MIGUEL
D: Whadda you know?
N: As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.
C: MIGUEL
D: So, how far is this guitar anyway?
C: HÉCTOR
D: We're almost there...
N: Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground below. But his bones reassemble immediately.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Keep up, chamaco, come on!
E: CONT'D
N: Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.
S: EXT. SHANTY TOWN
N: Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings the color of marigolds. Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and dusty, not unlike Héctor, but there's a camaraderie about them.
C: RATTY GROUP
D: COUSIN HÉCTOR!!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Eh! These guys!
C: RATTY MEMBER
D: HÉCTOR!!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey Tío! Qué onda!
C: MIGUEL
D: These people are all your family?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever.
E: beat
N: They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up.
C: TÍA CHELO

D: Tía Chelo! He-hey!
N: Héctor hands them a bottle.
C: OLD TIAS
D: Muchas gracias!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey, hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharrón around?
C: TÍA CHELO
D: In the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors...
C: HÉCTOR
D: Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?
S: INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT
N: Héctor holds the curtain open. Miguel and Dante walk in. The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over. Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of CHICHARRÓN.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Buenas noches, Chicharrón!
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor.
C: HÉCTOR
D: C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I brought you a little offering!
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Get out of here...
C: HÉCTOR
D: I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar.
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: My guitar?!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Yes?
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: My prized, beloved guitar...?
C: HÉCTOR
D: I promise we'll bring it right back.
N: Chicharrón sits up, incensed.
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Like the time you promised to bring back my van?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Uh...
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Or my mini-fridge?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ah, you see­-
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Or my good napkins? My lasso? My femur?!
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, no, not like those times.
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Where's my femur?! You--
N: Chicharrón raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden flicker flashing through his bones. Héctor rushes forward.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it. I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. You play me something.
E: looking to guitar beat
N: Héctor looks surprised.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: You want it, you got to earn it...
N: Héctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharrón and takes the instrument.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Only for you, amigo. Any requests?
N: Héctor begins tuning the guitar.
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: You know my favorite, Héctor.
N: Héctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharrón smiles. Miguel's eyes go wide at Héctor's skill.

D: There are children present. HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!
E: continuing
N: Héctor finishes with a soft flourish. Chicharrón is tickled, joyful. For a moment he's present and bright.
C: CHICHARRÓN
D: Brings back memories. Gracias...
N: His eyes close. He looks at peace. Héctor looks sad. Suddenly, the edges of Chicharrón's bones begin to glow. A soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust. Miguel is stunned, concerned. Héctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharrón's glass, which is still full.
C: MIGUEL
D: Wait... what happened?
C: HÉCTOR
D: He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the "Final Death."
E: beat
C: MIGUEL
D: Where did he go?
C: HÉCTOR
D: No one knows.
N: Miguel has a thought.
C: MIGUEL
D: But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back...
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories...
N: Miguel is deep in thought. Héctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.
E: CONT'D
N: He gives Miguel the guitar.
C: HÉCTOR
D: C'mon "de la Cruzcito." You've got a contest to win.
E: CONT'D
N: Héctor throws open the curtain and exits. Miguel looks back at the glasses, then turns and follows.
S: EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD
N: Héctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley. Miguel holds Héctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while Héctor fiddles on the guitar idly.
C: MIGUEL
D: You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one.
C: HÉCTOR
D: How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows.
N: Héctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note.
C: MIGUEL
D: No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much.
C: MIGUEL
D: You don't know what you're talking about...
N: The trolley arrives at the stop for the PLAZA DE LA CRUZ. There's a giant statue of Ernesto de la Cruz in the center. Miguel pockets Héctor's photo.

S: EXT. BACKSTAGE
N: Miguel and Héctor stand amongst other contestants.
C: HÉCTOR
D: So what's the plan? What are you gonna play?
C: MIGUEL
D: Definitely "Remember Me."
N: Miguel plucks out the beginnings of de la Cruz's most famous song. Héctor clamps his hand over the fretboard.
C: HÉCTOR
D: No, not that one. No.
C: MIGUEL
D: C'mon, it's his most popular song!
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ehck, it's too popular.

C: HÉCTOR
D: You always this nervous before a performance?
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't know -- I've never performed before.

D: What?! You said you were a musician!

C: HÉCTOR
D: I'll go up there--
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel recoils, keeping hold of the instrument.
C: MIGUEL
D: No! I need to do this.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Why?
C: MIGUEL
D: If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician?
C: HÉCTOR

N: The sound is full-throated and resonant. People in the audience whistle and whoop. Some return the grito, some applaud lightly. His brows go up and he begins his guitar intro.

S: EXT. PEDESTRIAN THOROUGHFARE
N: Miguel hustles to get away from Héctor. Dante bounds after him, but looks back and whimpers. He barks to get Miguel's attention.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante, cállate!
N: But Dante is insistent. He tugs at Miguel's pants, pulling him back to Héctor.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, Dante! Stop it! He can't help me!
E: CONT'D
N: Dante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts.

D: Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here!
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back, rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd. Startled skeletons see Miguel's arms. He hurries to get his hoodie back on.
C: CROWD MEMBERS
D: It's him! / It's that living boy! / I heard about him. / Look! / He's alive! / The boy's alive.
N: Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path! He skids to a stop.
C: MIGUEL
D: AAHH!
N: Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more terrifying sight: Mamá Imelda riding atop.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home!
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't want your blessing!
N: Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley staircase.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel! Stop!
N: Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced to pursue Miguel on foot.

D: Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE...
E: singing
N: Miguel stops in his tracks. When Imelda finishes, he turns back, confused.
C: MIGUEL
D: I thought you hated music.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Oh, I loved it. I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world.
E: reminiscing
N: Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice.
E: CONT'D
C: MIGUEL
D: But I don't wanna... pick sides! Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. But you never will.
E: beat beat
N: Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la Cruz's tower.
S: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
N: Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower. Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages) drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a funicular that scales the tower to the mansion. A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Have a good time.
C: GUEST
D: Oh, how exciting!
N: EL SANTO, the silver-masked luchador, produces a fancy invitation to the security guard.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Oh! El Santo! I'm a big fan.
E: giddy
N: The security guard sheepishly holds up a camera.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: You mind if I--
N: El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take the photo.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Gracias, señor!
N: The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line behind him.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Invitation?
C: MIGUEL
D: It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson!
N: Miguel strikes de la Cruz's signature pose with his guitar.

T: CUT TO:
N: The Band Leader hands an invitation to the security guard.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Ooo, the competition winners! Congratulations chicos!
N: Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone player angling his instrument away from the security guard. After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a deep "TOOT!" Miguel spills out onto the floor of the funicular.
C: MIGUEL
D: Thanks guys!
N: The funicular ascends.
S: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
N: The doors of the funicular open to reveal de la Cruz's lavish mansion. Los Chachalacos all file out.
C: MIGUEL
D: Whoa...
C: BAND LEADER
D: Enjoy the party, little músico!
C: MIGUEL
D: Gracias!
N: Miguel heads off toward the mansion. On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling -- performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines. A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry of butterflies.
C: GUEST
D: Look, it's Ernesto!
N: Miguel catches a glimpse of de la Cruz heading deeper into the party. Miguel pursues.
C: MIGUEL
D: De la Cruz...
S: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
N: Miguel heads into the foyer but loses de la Cruz in the crowd.
C: MIGUEL
D: Señor de la Cruz!
N: Miguel elbows his way through the room.
C: MIGUEL
D: Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
N: He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from de la Cruz's movies. DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by. You must seize it. Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades- spanning mash-up soundtrack. A clip of de la Cruz riding his noble steed plays behind Miguel. DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) We're almost there, Dante. Miguel jumps to see above the crowd.
C: MIGUEL
D: Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
N: Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's attention. Meanwhile, a clip behind Miguel features de la Cruz as a good-natured priest:
C: NUN
D: But what can we do? It is hopeless...
E: FILM CLIP
N: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) You must have faith, sister.
C: NUN
D: Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
E: FILM CLIP
N: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) He will listen... to MUSIC! The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd. Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
T: The DJ fades the music.
N: Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar. More guests turn. As a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar becomes singular.
C: MIGUEL
E: singing

D: TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT BRINGS ME JOY! ¡QUÉ ALEGRÍA! FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
N: Miguel continues to play and sing as he nervously walks forward; the crowd parting, he moves closer to DLC.
C: MIGUEL
D: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
N: He passes a movie screen where a clip features de la Cruz singing the same song in one of his films, the songs overlapping for a brief moment. MIGUEL & DE LA CRUZ FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA Miguel's soul pours into the strings as he approaches his hero--
C: MIGUEL
D: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
N: SPLASH! Miguel tumbles into the indoor pool. The party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Are you all right, niño?
N: Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run, revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide. The crowd gasps and murmurs.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: It's you... you, you are that boy, the one who came from the Land of the Living.
C: MIGUEL
D: You... know about me?
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: You are all anyone has been talking about! Why have you come here?
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson.

S: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
N: Quick cuts over instrumental version of "Remember Me:" De la Cruz barges into several conversations, proudly introducing Miguel. He seems almost giddy. They wedge themselves into a group laughing in the garden (which includes Jorge Negrete & Pedro Infante):
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson?

C: DE LA CRUZ
D: All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living! They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!
N: Miguel takes in the room, it's almost too much to absorb. Something seems to be on the boy's mind.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed...
C: MIGUEL
D: No -- it's all great.
C: DE LA CRUZ

D: And whose fault is that?

C: HÉCTOR

N: Héctor's suitcase is opened. A hand reaches in to take the songbook.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I never thought that you might have... that you...
N: BACK TO:
S: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
N: Héctor clenches his jaw. Then he bounds at de la Cruz, tackling him to the ground.
C: HÉCTOR
D: How could you?!
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Security! Security!
N: Miguel watches as Héctor and Ernesto scuffle on the floor.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You took everything away from me!
N: Security guards rush in to pull Héctor off Ernesto. Héctor struggles, but it's no use.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You rat!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Have him taken care of. He's not well.
N: The guards drag Héctor through a wide doorway.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I just wanted to go back home! No, no, NO!
N: The doors slam shut and cut off his shouts. Miguel is left alone with de la Cruz.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: I apologize. Where were we?
C: MIGUEL
D: You were going to give me your blessing...
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Yes. Uh... sí.
N: De la Cruz pulls up a marigold petal, but hesitates.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Miguel, my reputation, it is very important to me. I would hate to have you think...
C: MIGUEL
D: That you murdered Héctor... for his songs?
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: You don't think that. Do you?
C: MIGUEL
D: I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy.
N: Doubt enters Miguel's mind. De la Cruz darkens, he places the photo of Héctor in his coat pocket, gears turning in his mind.
C: MIGUEL
D: Papá Ernesto? My blessing?
N: De la Cruz crumples the marigold petal.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Security!
N: De la Cruz's guards appear in the doorway.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay.
E: CONT'D
N: The guards grab Miguel by the shoulder.
C: MIGUEL
D: What?! But I'm your family!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: And Héctor was my best friend.
N: Miguel goes pale.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Success doesn't come for free, Miguel. You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to... seize your moment. I know you understand.
N: Miguel is dragged away.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, NO!
S: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S TOWER
N: The guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion.
C: MIGUEL
D: Let go!
N: They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind the estate.
S: INT. CENOTE
C: MIGUEL
D: NO! AHHHHHH!
N: He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a stone island in the center.
C: MIGUEL
D: Help! Can anyone hear me? I wanna go home!
N: Miguel collapses on the stone island. His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders. The skeletal
T: transition is almost complete.
N: A moment of silence. He is alone. Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles.
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Kid?
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh, Héctor!
N: They run to each other. Héctor embraces Miguel. But Miguel is overcome with shame.
C: MIGUEL
D: You were right. I should have gone back to my family--
N: Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey -- hey, hey...
C: MIGUEL
D: They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen--
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey, it's okay...
C: MIGUEL
D: I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.
N: Héctor holds Miguel to his chest. Miguel is tense.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hey, chamaco, it's okay. It's okay.
C: MIGUEL
D: I told them I didn't care.
N: Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones, and he falls to his knees.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Hhuuh!
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor! Héctor--
C: HÉCTOR
D: She's... forgetting me.
N: Miguel looks at Héctor with concern.
C: MIGUEL
D: Who?
C: HÉCTOR
D: My daughter...
C: MIGUEL
D: She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge...
C: HÉCTOR
D: I just wanted to see her again... I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco...
E: beat beat
N: A chill runs through Miguel.
C: MIGUEL
D: Coco?
N: Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician. Miguel shows the photo to Héctor. Héctor is confused; it's like he's seen a ghost.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Where... where did you get this?
C: MIGUEL
D: That's my Mamá Coco. That's my Mamá Imelda. Is that... you?
N: Gears turn in both of their heads.
C: HÉCTOR
D: We're...
C: HÉCTOR MIGUEL
D: ...family? ...family?
N: Héctor is as shocked as Miguel. He looks at his great-great grandson. He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he becomes saddened.
C: HÉCTOR
D: I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world...
E: beat beat beat
C: MIGUEL
D: You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her...
C: HÉCTOR
D: ...Ever again.
N: Héctor is quiet for a moment.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time.
N: Héctor sings softly, plaintively.

D: You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!
E: CONT'D
C: HÉCTOR
D: I didn't write "Remember Me" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa.
C: MIGUEL
D: Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade!
N: Héctor doesn't smile. Miguel kneels close.
C: MIGUEL
D: My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family!

E: CONT'D
N: Héctor perks up.
C: HÉCTOR TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY!
D: I'm proud to be HIS family!
N: They trade off their gritos until the cenote echoes with the sound. Soon though, the echoes fade. They're still stuck. Suddenly they hear a distant howling.
C: DANTE
D: Rooo-rooo-roooooooo!
E: O.S
N: Miguel and Héctor look up.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante?
C: DANTE
D: Roooooo-roo-roo-rooo!
E: O.S. louder
N: Up at the top of the cenote, Dante pokes his head in the opening.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante! It's Dante!
N: Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar. Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to reveal Mamá Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mamá Imelda laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon Héctor.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Imelda!
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Héctor.
E: icy
C: HÉCTOR
D: You look good...
S: EXT. CENOTE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Pepita flies out of the cenote; Imelda, Héctor, Miguel, and Dante ride on her back. She ascends above the clouds.
S: EXT. NIGHT SKY
N: Miguel, wind in his hair, hugs Dante fiercely.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante, you knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide! Who's a good spirit guide? You are!
E: doggy-praise
N: Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws. Dante begins to freak out.
C: MIGUEL
D: Whoa...
N: A pair of little wings sprout on the dog's back. He spreads them. He jumps up to fly... and plummets beneath the clouds!
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante!
N: But then he's back up, flapping goofily and barking his head off, a full-blown spirit guide!
S: EXT. SMALL PLAZA
N: Pepita flies in, landing in a small plaza where the other Riveras wait.
C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Look, there they are!
N: The Dead Riveras come rushing up.
C: FAMILY
D: Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all right! / Oh thank goodness! / Gracias, Dios mío!
N: They dismount from Pepita. Héctor falls off first but gets up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick. Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight hug.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time!
N: Imelda's eyes fall on Héctor, who holds his hat in his hands sheepishly.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: And you! How many times must I turn you away?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Imelda--
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death! I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
E: beat
N: Miguel steps between Imelda and Héctor.
C: MIGUEL
D: I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor. He was in there `cause of me. He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family.
E: beat
N: Mamá Imelda looks at Héctor, shocked to hear the sentiment.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Héctor's photo.
E: CONT'D
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: What?
C: MIGUEL
D: So he can see Coco again. Héctor should be on our ofrenda. He's part of our family--
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: He left this family!
C: MIGUEL
D: He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him!
N: Startled, she looks to Héctor for confirmation.
C: HÉCTOR
D: It's true, Imelda.
N: Imelda wrestles with her emotions.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you?
C: HÉCTOR
D: Imelda, I--
N: Héctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded. Imelda gasps.
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor?
C: HÉCTOR
D: I'm running out of time. It's Coco...
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: She's forgetting you...
C: MIGUEL
D: You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but--
E: to Héctor
C: HÉCTOR
D: This is my fault, not yours. I'm sorry, Imelda.
E: beat
N: Mamá Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home? No more music?
C: MIGUEL
D: Family comes first.
N: Mamá Imelda considers. She turns to Héctor.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I -- I can't forgive you. But I will help you.
N: Miguel smiles.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: So how do we get to de la Cruz?
E: to Miguel
N: Miguel furrows his brow.
C: MIGUEL
D: I might know a way...
S: EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN
N: Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to their seats as the lights begin to dim. ON STAGE Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the painted on unibrow. The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their bodies nonsensically. A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all the dancers slink to it. In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights and to the wings of the stage. STAGE WING
C: FRIDA
D: Good luck, muchacho.
C: MIGUEL
D: Gracias Frida!
S: INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor, shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow.
C: MIGUEL
D: Ow!
N: Dante has snuck in under Tío Oscar's skirt. Héctor sees that Imelda is tangled up in her outfit.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Here, let me help you with--

C: PAPÁ JULIO
D: Give it to Miguel.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Send Miguel home.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Got your petals?
N: Each family member raises a marigold petal. Imelda leads the way out of the corridor.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Now, we just have to find de la Cruz--
N: Right around the corner is de la Cruz who turns with a smile.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Yes?
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Ah!
N: The family stops in their tracks, still hidden from de la Cruz's view. It's just him and Imelda. His smile drops.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Don't I know you?
N: Imelda pulls off her shoe and slaps de la Cruz across the face with it.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: That's for murdering the love of my life!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Who the?
E: disoriented
N: Héctor leaps out from around the corner.
C: HÉCTOR
D: She's talking about me! I'm the love of your life?
E: to Imelda
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I don't know! I'm still angry at you.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Héctor?! How did you--
N: Imelda slaps de la Cruz again.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: And that's for trying to murder my grandson!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Grandson?
N: Now Miguel leaps out of the corridor.
C: MIGUEL
D: She's talking about me!
N: De la Cruz sees the three of them and puts the pieces together.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: You! Wait, you're related to Héctor?
N: Miguel sees the photo in de la Cruz's pocket.
C: MIGUEL
D: The photo!
N: The rest of the Riveras emerge from the corridor. Outnumbered, de la Cruz turns and runs.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: After him!
S: INT. BELOW STAGE
N: De la Cruz knocks over a group of giant sugar skull dancers. He emerges at a full sprint to where his rising platform is set up.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Security! Ayúdenme!
N: The Riveras flood out after him. Héctor jogs next to Imelda.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You said "love of your life..."
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I don't know WHAT I said!
C: MIGUEL
D: That's what I heard...
N: A brawl ensues between the family and the guards. De la Cruz runs to a stage door.
C: STAGEHAND
D: Places, señor, you're on in 30 seconds!
N: De la Cruz shoves the stagehand out of the way. As security guards try to wrangle the Riveras, Imelda reaches de la Cruz and gets her hands on Héctor's photo. De la Cruz scuffles with her to get it back, when Miguel tackles de la Cruz to the ground. De la Cruz loses his grip; Imelda tumbles backward, photo in hand.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel! I have it!
N: Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards. Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to the stage. De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her. Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, Héctor, Tía Victoria, and Tía Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la Cruz.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hurry, come on!
N: Papá Julio, Tío Oscar, and Tío Felipe block the guards from following the others. ON STAGE
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen... the one, the only... ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ!

C: CROWD MEMBER
D: Nesto!
N: Imelda appears onscreen for all to see. STAGE WING RIGHT De la Cruz rushes up a staircase and arrives in the wings. He gets the attention of his guards and points to Imelda.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Get her off the stage!
N: His guards hustle onto the stage, scaling the set to get to her. STAGE WING LEFT Miguel, Héctor, Victoria, and Rosita emerge to see Imelda spotlit above them. ON STAGE De la Cruz's guards begin to approach Imelda. She is frozen, unable to move.
C: MIGUEL
D: Sing!
E: O.S.
N: Mamá Imelda looks down and sees Miguel in the wing.
C: MIGUEL

D: LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE...
N: STAGE WING LEFT Héctor's mouth gapes open. Tía Victoria and Tía Rosita go wide-eyed. Miguel sets Héctor up with a guitar, then adjusts a mic stand in front of him. Héctor plays the guitar, its sound amplified through the stage speakers. ON STAGE
C: MAMÁ IMELDA AY DE MÍ, LLORONA
D: LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE...
N: The guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short, not wanting to interrupt the performance. Imelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,
C: NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE.
D: NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE!
N: As Héctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident. The audience begins to clap. De la Cruz grunts in frustration. Soon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation, which kicks into high gear.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: ME SUBÍ AL PINO MÁS ALTO, LLORONA, A VER SI TE DIVISABA.
N: She doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight with her as she moves to put distance between her and the guards. Imelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the spotlight, he runs away.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: COMO EL PINO ERA TIERNO, LLORONA

D: ...AY, AY, AY!
N: At the finale of the song, Imelda stomps her heel into de la Cruz's foot on his high note, causing him to let her go. She runs off stage with the photo. BACKSTAGE Imelda arrives off stage and, somewhat high on adrenaline, she embraces Héctor.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: I forgot what that felt like.
N: Héctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the impropriety, pulls away from him awkwardly.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You... still got it.
N: They smile at each other, softening. Miguel, off to the side, clears his throat.
C: MIGUEL
D: Ahem.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Oh!
N: Imelda, now reminded, gives Miguel the photo. She pulls out her petal.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA

N: The petal surges. Miguel brightens, touched.
C: HÉCTOR
D: You're going home.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: You're not going anywhere!
N: Suddenly Miguel is yanked away from his great-great grandparents by de la Cruz. De la Cruz has grabbed Miguel by the scruff of his hoodie. Imelda lunges at de la Cruz, but he pushes her to the floor.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Imelda--
N: De la Cruz drags Miguel away as his family encroaches.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Stay back! Stay back. All of you!
N: De la Cruz drags Miguel further and further back on the stage.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Stay back! Not one more step.
N: Dante growls and tries to grab Miguel.
C: MIGUEL
D: Dante!
N: De la Cruz pulls Miguel away, closer to the ledge of the building. Héctor struggles but continues pursuing de la Cruz.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone!
E: winded
N: Héctor stumbles, shimmering like before. He falls to the ground.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: I've worked too hard, Héctor... Too hard to let him destroy everything...
N: In the stage wings, Tía Rosita commandeers one of the cameras and points it toward de la Cruz. Tía Victoria sidles up to a control board and pushes a volume dial up.
C: HÉCTOR
D: He's a living child, Ernesto!
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: He's a threat!
T: CUT TO:
N: STADIUM The image of de la Cruz holding Miguel hostage is projected on the stadium screens, the audience falls to a hush as they watch. BACK TO: BACKSTAGE Miguel struggles against de la Cruz.

C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Apologies old friend, but the show must go on...
T: CUT TO:
N: Miguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the wind whips against his face, he hears a faint howling. Dante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone from sight. Miguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt rips and Dante loses him. Miguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards the water. The photo is lost. BACK TO: BACKSTAGE De la Cruz steps up to the curtain, slicks back his hair, and emerges to his audience. ON STAGE De la Cruz is found by a spotlight.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Ha ha!

N: The crowd pelts de la Cruz with fruit and offerings.
C: CROWD MEMBER
D: Look!
N: Crowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing and runs to his family.
C: CROWD MEMBER
D: He's alright!
N: The crowd cheers. There are sighs of relief. De la Cruz, seeing this play out on screen, realizes his backstage treachery has been projected to the whole world. He watches horrified as the image of Pepita grows larger and larger on the screen as she prowls past the camera. De la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through the curtain, eyes locked on him.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: Nice kitty...
N: Suddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please! I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO!
N: She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over the audience.
C: DE LA CRUZ
D: NO! AAAHHH!
N: He flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers. In the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member returns from concessions.
C: CROWD MEMBER
D: What did I miss?
N: BACK TO: BACK STAGE Miguel is surrounded by family, safe. He hugs Dante.
C: MIGUEL
D: Good boy, Dante.
N: Imelda runs to Miguel and embraces him.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel!
N: Behind them, Héctor struggles to get to his feet but stumbles with a flicker. Miguel runs to support him.
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor! The photo, I lost it...
C: HÉCTOR
D: It's okay, mijo. It's--
N: Suddenly Héctor suffers his most violent flickering yet. He collapses. Miguel kneels by him.
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor! Héctor?!
N: Héctor can barely move his limbs.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Coco...
C: MIGUEL
D: No! We can still find the photo...
N: Mamá Imelda looks to the horizon, the first rays of sunlight peeking over.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: Miguel, it's almost sunrise!
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no, no, I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco!
N: Héctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full skeleton now.
C: HÉCTOR
D: We're both out of time, mijo.
N: The shimmering of Héctor's bones advances.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, no... she can't forget you!
C: HÉCTOR
D: I just wanted her to know that I loved her.
N: Héctor musters the strength to grab the marigold petal.
C: MIGUEL
D: Héctor--
C: HÉCTOR
D: You have our blessing, Miguel.
C: MAMÁ IMELDA
D: No conditions.
N: The petal glows. Héctor struggles to lift the petal to Miguel. Mamá Imelda takes his hand in hers.
C: MIGUEL
D: No, Papá Héctor, please!
N: Imelda and Héctor move their joined hands toward Miguel's chest.
C: MIGUEL
D: No...
N: Héctor's eyelids begin to close.
C: HÉCTOR
D: Go home...
C: MIGUEL
D: I promise I won't let Coco forget you! Aaahh!--
N: WHOOOOSH! A whirlwind of marigold petals, and everything goes white.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - SUNRISE
N: Miguel finds himself back in de la Cruz's tomb. Dazed, he looks through the windows; day has broken. On the floor is the skull guitar. Miguel grabs it. He exits the tomb and takes off out of the cemetery.
S: EXT. PLAZA
N: Miguel races through the plaza, past the statue of de la Cruz. Miguel races through the streets towards home. He blows right past his Tío Berto snoring and Primo Abel sleeping on a bench.
C: TÍO BERTO
D: There he is!
E: jolting awake
N: Abel falls off the bench. Papá comes from around a corner as Miguel is running.
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel!? Stop!
S: EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND
N: Miguel rounds the corner and follows the trail of marigolds through the front gate. He runs for Mamá Coco's bedroom. Just as he makes it to the doorway, Abuelita steps up and blocks him.
C: ABUELITA
D: Where have you been?!
C: MIGUEL
D: Ah! I need to see Mamá Coco, please--
N: Abuelita spies the guitar in Miguel's hand.
C: ABUELITA
D: What are you doing with that? Give it to me!
N: Miguel pushes past Abuelita, and slams the door shut.
C: ABUELITA
D: Miguel! Stop! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! MIGUEL!
S: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM
N: Miguel locks the door and goes up to Mamá Coco. She stares into space, eyes completely vacant.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel.
N: Miguel looks into her eyes.
C: MIGUEL
D: I saw your papá. Remember? Papá? Please -- if you forget him, he'll be gone... forever!
E: CONT'D
N: She doesn't respond. Miguel's father bangs on the door.
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel, open this door!
E: O.S.
N: Miguel shows her the guitar.
C: MIGUEL
D: Here -- this was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See, there he is.
N: Still nothing. Her eyes are glazed.
C: MIGUEL
D: Papá, remember? Papá?
E: CONT'D
N: Mamá Coco stares forward, as if Miguel isn't even there.
C: PAPÁ
D: Miguel!
E: O.S.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco, please, don't forget him.
N: With a rattle of keys, the door flies open. The family pours in.
C: ABUELITA
D: What are you doing to that poor woman?
N: Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.
C: ABUELITA
D: It's okay, Mamita, it's okay.
C: PAPÁ
D: What's gotten into you?
N: Miguel looks down, defeated. Tears drip off his nose. Papá's anger gives way to relief. He embraces his son.
C: PAPÁ
D: I thought I'd lost you, Migue...
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm sorry, Papá.
N: Mamá steps forward.
C: MAMÁ
D: We're all together now, that's what matters.
C: MIGUEL
D: Not all of us...
N: Abuelita returns from consoling Mamá Coco.
C: ABUELITA
D: It's okay, mamita. Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá Coco!
E: beat
N: Miguel looks at Mamá Coco and approaches her.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco...
N: His toe accidentally taps against Héctor's skull guitar, a soft hollow ringing resonates.
C: ABUELITA
D: Well? Apologize.
N: He comes to a realization.
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted you to have this.
N: He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene but Papá places a hand on her shoulder.
C: PAPÁ
D: Mamá, wait--
N: Miguel starts to sing "Remember Me" the way Héctor sang it... softly, from the heart.
C: MIGUEL
E: singing
C: REMEMBER ME
D: THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
C: REMEMBER ME
D: DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
C: MAMÁ
D: Look...
N: The glimmer in the Mamá Coco's eyes grows brighter with every note. Memories flood in, filling the vacancy of her expression with life. Her cheeks soften and plump. Her lips arc into a smile.
C: MIGUEL
D: FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY, I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
E: MORE
C: MIGUEL REMEMBER ME
D: THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
E: CONT'D
N: Miguel sings gently, with love. Mamá Coco's brows slope up, delighted. The song seems to bring her back to life. Abuelita can't speak. None of them can. Brimming, Mamá Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice scratchy with age, his clear with youth.
C: MAMA COCO MIGUEL REMEMBER ME REMEMBER ME
D: EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD
C: GUITAR GUITAR
D: KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME. REMEMBER ME.
N: Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a miracle. Mamá Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her tears.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Elena? What's wrong, mija?
C: ABUELITA
D: Nothing Mamá. Nothing at all.
N: Mamá Coco turns to Miguel.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: My papá used to sing me that song.
C: MIGUEL
D: He loved you, Mamá Coco. Your papá loved you so much.
N: A smile spreads across Mamá Coco's face. She's waited a long time to hear those words. She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking. She opens a drawer and pulls out a notebook.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: I kept... his letters... poems he wrote me... and...
N: Mamá Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from the photo -- Héctor's face. Miguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing Héctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man. Mamá Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks with fondness and love.
C: MAMÁ COCO
D: Papá was a musician. When I was a little girl, he and Mamá would sing such beautiful songs...
N: The family gathers close to listen.

E: O.S.

E: CONT'D
N: Abuelita approaches and smiles to see her grandson passing on the tradition. Then she places a picture frame on the ofrenda, a photo of Mamá Coco. She looks to Miguel who puts his arm around her. Next to Mamá Coco's picture sits the photo of Mamá Imelda and Héctor, taped back together. Restored.

N: Dante and Pepita fly through the night sky in the Land of the Dead. They alight on the marigold path and bound across into the Land of the Living.
S: EXT. STREETS OF SANTA CECILIA
N: Dante's shadow is cast against a wall. When he rounds the corner, he is just a normal xolo dog, no wings or vibrant colors. Pepita's shadow looms large, but as she rounds the corner it shrinks to reveal that she is a little alley cat in the Land of the Living.
S: EXT. RIVERA COURTYARD
N: They enter the Rivera compound. Abuelita greets Dante and tosses him a sweet treat. In the courtyard, the family is gathered as Miguel plays his guitar and sings. Dante hops up to give him a lick on the cheek.
