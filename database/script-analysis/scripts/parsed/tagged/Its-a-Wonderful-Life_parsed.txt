T: FADE IN:
N: NIGHT SEQUENCE Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above scenes we hear voices praying:
C: GOWER'S VOICE
D: I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father.
C: MARTINI'S VOICE
D: Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr. Bailey.
C: MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE
D: Help my son George tonight.
C: BERT'S VOICE
D: He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble.
C: ERNIE'S VOICE
D: George is a good guy. Give him a break, God.
C: MARY'S VOICE
D: I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight.
C: JANIE'S VOICE
D: Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy.
C: ZUZU'S VOICE
D: Please bring Daddy back.
N: CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: Hello, Joseph, trouble?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
N: A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence speaks:
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: You sent for me, sir?
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Splendid! Is he sick?
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Sir... If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: What's that book you've got there?
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
C: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
D: Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Poor George... Sit down.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Sit down? What are...
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Well, naturally. Of course.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
N: The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Where? I don't see a thing.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
N: The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Why, yes. This is amazing.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Oh, wonderful!
S: EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT
N: Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.
C: BOY
D: Yippee!!
E: as he slides
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Hey, who's that?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: That's your problem, George Bailey.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: A boy?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
N: Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others applaud. CLOSE SHOT George Bailey at bottom of slide.
C: GEORGE
D: And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey.
E: through megaphone
N: CLOSE SHOT  HARRY On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.
C: HARRY
D: I'm not scared.
C: BOYS
D: Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!
E: ad lib
N: MEDIUM SHOT Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE
C: GEORGE
D: I'm coming, Harry.
N: MEDIUM SHOT George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he yells:
C: GEORGE
D: Make a chain, gang! A chain!
N: WIDER ANGLE The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: George saved his brother's life that day. But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks before he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's drugstore.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON
N: MEDIUM SHOT Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling. Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street. MEDIUM PAN SHOT The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it. CLOSE SHOT The boys watching the carriage.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Potter!
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Who's that  a king?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county.
N: The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:
C: GEORGE
D: So long!
C: BOYS
D: Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee- haw.
E: ad lib
S: INTERIOR DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:
C: GEORGE
D: Wish I had a million dollars.
N: He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.
C: GEORGE
D: Hot dog!
N: WIDER ANGLE George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain.
C: GEORGE
D: It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
E: calling toward back room
N: CLOSE SHOT Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. We see him take a drink from a bottle.
C: GOWER
D: You're late.
N: MEDIUM SHOT George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir.
N: WIDER ANGLE Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.
C: VIOLET
D: Hello, George. 'Lo, Mary.
E: with warm friendliness then, flatly, as she sees Mary
C: MARY
D: Hello, Violet.
E: primly
N: George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter.
C: GEORGE
D: Two cents worth of shoelaces?
C: VIOLET
D: She was here first.
C: MARY
D: I'm still thinking.
C: GEORGE
D: Shoelaces?
E: to Violet
C: VIOLET
D: Please, Georgie.
N: George goes over to the candy counter.
C: VIOLET
D: I like him.
E: to Mary
C: MARY
D: You like every boy.
C: VIOLET
D: What's wrong with that?
E: happily
C: GEORGE
D: Here you are.
N: George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces. Violet gives him the money.
C: VIOLET
D: Help me down?
E: the vamp
C: GEORGE
D: Help you down!
E: disgusted
N: Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN
C: GEORGE
D: Made up your mind yet?
C: MARY
D: I'll take chocolate.
N: George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.
C: GEORGE
D: With coconuts?
C: MARY
D: I don't like coconuts.
C: GEORGE
D: You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
N: He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.
C: MARY
D: A new magazine! I never saw it before.
C: GEORGE
D: Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
N: He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. She leans over, speaking softly. CLOSE SHOT Mary, whispering.
C: MARY
D: Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.
N: She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said. CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
C: GEORGE
D: I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives. Wait and see.
N: He turns back to the cash register, whistling. ANOTHER ANGLE Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking.
C: GOWER
D: George! George!
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir.
C: GOWER
D: You're not paid to be a canary.
C: GEORGE
D: No, sir.
N: He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it. INSERT: THE TELEGRAM It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions from you. EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE." BACK TO SHOT George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower.
S: INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower, do you want something... Anything?
C: GOWER
D: No.
C: GEORGE
D: Anything I can do back here?
C: GOWER
D: No.
N: George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor. CLOSE SHOT Capsules spilling on floor at their feet. BACK TO SHOT George and Gower.
C: GEORGE
D: I'll get them, sir.
N: He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George stands still, horrified.
C: GOWER
D: Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's. She's waiting for them.
N: George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say. His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George's fingers fumble.
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
C: GOWER
D: Ummmm...
N: Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box in his hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Is it a charge, sir?
C: GOWER
D: Yes  charge.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower, I think...
C: GOWER
D: Aw, get going!
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir.
S: INT. DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says: INSERT "ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL BACK TO SHOT With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary follows him with her eyes.
S: EXT. STREET  DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two- story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY
N: FULL SHOT The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked: "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. CLOSE SHOT Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
C: GEORGE
D: Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Some other time, George.
C: GEORGE
D: It's important.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
N: During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, and now she calls out:
C: COUSIN TILLY
D: Uncle Billy... telephone.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Who is it?
C: COUSIN TILLY
D: Bank examiner.
N: INSERT CLOSEUP  UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do. BACK TO SHOT Uncle Billy looking at his hand.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Bank examiner! I should have called him yesterday. Switch it inside.
N: He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his father's office and enters.
S: INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE  DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time.
C: BAILEY
D: I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
C: POTTER
D: Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
C: BAILEY
D: All I'm asking is thirty days more...
C: GEORGE
D: Pop!
E: interrupting
C: BAILEY
D: Just a minute, son. Just thirty short days. I'll dig up that five thousand somehow.
E: to Potter
C: POTTER
D: Shove me up...
E: to his goon
N: Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.
C: GEORGE
D: Pop!
C: POTTER
D: Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
C: BAILEY
D: Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
C: POTTER
D: Then foreclose!
C: BAILEY
D: I can't do that. These families have children.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY
C: GEORGE
D: Pop!
C: POTTER
D: They're not my children.
C: BAILEY
D: But they're somebody's children.
C: POTTER
D: Are you running a business or a charity ward?
C: BAILEY
D: Well, all right...
C: POTTER
D: Not with my money!
E: interrupting
N: CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY
C: BAILEY
D: Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
C: POTTER
D: So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
N: George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. He comes around in front of the desk.
C: GEORGE
D: He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!
C: BAILEY
D: George, George...
C: GEORGE
D: You're not! You're the biggest man in town!
C: BAILEY
D: Run along.
N: He pushes George toward the door.
C: GEORGE
D: Bigger'n him!
N: As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Bigger'n everybody.
N: George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. As they go:
C: POTTER
D: Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT George and his father at the door.
C: GEORGE
D: Don't let him say that about you, Pop.
C: BAILEY
D: All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.
N: Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand. WIPE TO: BACK TO DRUGSTORE
S: INT. BACK ROOM  GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT Gower talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway.
C: GOWER
D: Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago. It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.
E: drunkenly
N: He hangs up the phone and turns to George.
C: GOWER
D: Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
N: He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room.
C: GEORGE
D: Capsules...
C: GOWER
D: Did you hear what I said?
E: shaking him
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir, I...
E: frightened
N: Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands. George tries to protect himself as best he can.
C: GOWER
D: What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway? Why didn't you deliver them right away? Don't you know that boy's very sick?
C: GEORGE
D: You're hurting my sore ear.
E: in tears
S: INT. FRONT ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces.
S: INT. BACK ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND GOWER
C: GOWER
D: You lazy loafer!
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got that telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad in those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower...
E: sobbing
N: George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously.
C: GEORGE
D: Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison! I tell you, it's poison! I know you feel bad... and...
N: George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him.
C: GEORGE
D: Don't hurt my sore ear again.
N: But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too.
C: GOWER
D: No... No... No...
C: GEORGE
D: Don't hurt my ear again!
C: GOWER
D: Oh, George, George...
E: sobbing
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
C: GOWER
D: Oh, George.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LUGGAGE SHOP  DAY  (1928)
N: MEDIUM SHOT It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase.
C: JOE
D: An overnight bag  genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs...
C: CUSTOMER

C: GEORGE
D: Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe. Now, look, I... I want a big one.
N: Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from Heaven:
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: What did you stop it for?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: I want you to take a good look at that face.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Who is it?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: George Bailey.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: That's the kid.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Not a soul.
C: CLARENCE'S VOICE
D: Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
C: JOSEPH'S VOICE
D: Well, wait and see.
N: CLOSE SHOT  THE SCREEN The arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again.

C: JOE
D: I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you?
N: He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter.
C: GEORGE
D: Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
C: JOE
D: No charge.
C: GEORGE
D: That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.

S: INT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the local small fry. There are now three kids jerking sodas. Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored. He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
C: GOWER
D: Aw, forget it.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, it's wonderful.

C: ERNIE
D: Sure, your highness, hop in. And, for the carriage trade, I puts on my hat.

N: She goes up the stairs. Pop is smiling and poking his plate. A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare MUSIC. Down they come, holding their mother high between them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap.
C: BOYS
D: Here's a present for you, Pop.
N: Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
C: HARRY
D: I've eaten.
C: MOTHER
D: Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
C: HARRY
D: I don't care. It's George's tux.
N: Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out for her.
C: ANNIE
D: If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit you with this broom.
C: HARRY
D: Annie, I'm in love with you. There's a moon out tonight.
N: As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny. She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George and his mother sit down at the table.
C: GEORGE
D: Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal at the old Bailey boarding house.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!
N: CLOSE SHOT Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door.
C: HARRY
D: Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
C: MOTHER
D: What plates?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
N: She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. As she goes:
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
N: CLOSE SHOT George and his father, eating at the table. There is a great similarity and a great understanding between them.
C: POP
D: Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
C: POP
D: Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh...
C: POP
D: I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
C: GEORGE
D: I wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway?
C: POP
D: Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
N: MEDIUM SHOT The dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head. CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross.
C: HARRY
D: Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.
C: POP
D: So long, son.
C: GEORGE
D: Got a match?
C: HARRY
D: Very funny. Very funny.
C: MOTHER
D: Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
C: GEORGE
D: What do you mean, and be bored to death?
C: HARRY
D: Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
C: GEORGE
D: I hope it works.
C: POP
D: No gin tonight, son.
C: HARRY
D: Aw, Pop, just a little.
C: POP
D: No, son, not one drop.
N: CLOSE SHOT George and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes.
C: ANNIE
D: Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin?
N: She exits.
C: GEORGE
D: Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
C: POP
D: Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
C: GEORGE
D: We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
C: POP
D: He's pretty young for that job.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, no younger than I was.
C: POP
D: Maybe you were born older, George.
C: GEORGE
D: How's that?
C: POP
D: I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things... design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
C: POP
D: Still after that first million before you're thirty.
C: GEORGE
D: No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
N: Annie comes in again from the kitchen.
C: POP
D: Of course, it's just a hope, but you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
N: Annie stops serving to hear his answer.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I... Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on.
E: to Annie
C: ANNIE
D: I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to.
C: GEORGE
D: You would, huh?
N: She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George.
C: POP
D: I know it's soon to talk about it.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
N: He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
C: POP
D: You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.
E: quietly
C: GEORGE
D: I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But I've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to... Most of my friends have already finished college. I just feel like if I don't get away, I'd bust.
E: unhappily
C: POP
D: Yes... Yes... You're right, son.
C: GEORGE
D: You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
C: POP
D: This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
C: GEORGE
D: Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
N: To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls:
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, did you hear that, Annie?
N: CLOSE SHOT Annie listening through glass in door.
C: ANNIE
D: I heard it. About time one of you lunkheads said it.
N: CLOSE SHOT George and his father at the table.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
C: POP
D: Have a good time, son.
N: WIPE TO:
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT At one end of the room an orchestra is playing. George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table. He and Harry are carrying plates and pies.
C: GEORGE
D: Here you are.
N: Several of the boys take the plates from him. George looks at them, feeling very grown up and out of place.
C: HARRY
D: You know my kid brother, George. I'm going to put him through college.
E: introducing George
N: Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at his ears as he talks.
C: SAM
D: Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!
N: George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice. WIDER ANGLE Including Sam and Marty Hatch. Sam is assured and breezy, wearing very collegiate clothes.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
C: SAM
D: Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
C: GEORGE
D: Old college graduate now, huh?
C: SAM
D: Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
C: GEORGE
D: Yep.
N: Sam sees Harry and leaves George in the middle of a gesture.
C: SAM
D: Harry! You're the guy I want to see. Coach has heard all about you.
E: to Harry
C: HARRY
D: He has?
C: SAM
D: Yeah. He's followed every game and his mouth's watering. He wants me to find out if you're going to come along with us.
C: HARRY
D: Well, I gotta make some dough first.
C: SAM
D: Well, you better make it fast. We need great ends like you  not broken down old guys like this one.
N: George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other.
C: GEORGE
D: Hee-haw!
C: SAM
D: Hee-haw!
N: An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: George, welcome back.
C: GEORGE
D: Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea. Saved us another building. Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun. There's lots of stuff to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.
N: Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George. She is waving her dance program at him.
C: VIOLET
D: Hey, George...
C: GEORGE
D: Hello, Violet.
C: VIOLET
D: Hello, what am I bid?
N: Marty Hatch enters scene.
C: MARTY
D: George.
C: GEORGE
D: Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
C: MARTY
D: Do me a favor, will you, George?
C: GEORGE
D: What's that?
C: MARTY
D: Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, yeah, yeah.
C: SAM
D: "Momma wants you, Marty." "Momma wants you, Marty." Remember?
C: MARTY
D: Dance with her, will you?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
C: MARTY
D: Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
C: SAM
D: Aw, go on.
C: MARTY
D: Hey, sis.
E: calling off
C: GEORGE
D: Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be long, Marty. I don't want to be a wet nurse for...
N: He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her. CLOSEUP  MARY HATCH She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand. For the first time, she is wearing an evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration of the boy with her. She turns around and for the first time she sees George. For a second she loses her poise, staring at him.
C: FREDDIE'S VOICE
D: And the next thing I know, some guy came up and tripped me. That's the reason why I came in fourth. If it hadn't been for that...
N: CLOSE SHOT George, staring at Mary.
C: FREDDIE'S VOICE
D: ...that race would have been a cinch. I tried to find out who it was later...
N: CLOSEUP  MARY Still staring at George, and smiling.
C: FREDDIE'S VOICE
D: ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was because they'd be scared. They know...
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George.
C: FREDDIE
D: ...what kind of...
C: MARTY
D: You remember George? This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you.
E: interrupting
C: GEORGE
D: Well... Well... Well...
C: FREDDIE
D: Now, to get back to my story, see...
N: Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing.
C: FREDDIE
D: Hey, this is my dance!
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, why don't you stop annoying people?
C: FREDDIE
D: Well, I'm sorry. Hey!
N: MOVING SHOT Following George and Mary as they dance.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, hello.
C: MARY
D: Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I don't.
C: MARY
D: You've passed me on the street almost every day.
C: GEORGE
D: Me?
C: MARY
D: Uh-huh.
C: GEORGE
D: Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
N: A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops. CLOSE SHOT Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand.
C: HARRY
D: Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big Charleston contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup. Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let's go!
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm not very good at this.
C: MARY
D: Neither am I.
C: GEORGE
D: Okay  what can we lose?
N: They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. CLOSEUP  FREDDIE Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him.
C: MICKEY
D: What's the matter, Othello  jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up? And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack? And I've got the key?
N: Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool. George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for cheers. CLOSE SHOT George and Mary dancing.
C: GEORGE
D: They're cheering us. We must be good.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. SERIES OF SHOTS George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself.
T: FADE OUT FADE IN:
S: EXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing:
C: GEORGE AND MARY
D: Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight. Can't you come out tonight. Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon.
E: singing
C: GEORGE
D: Hot dog! Just like an organ.
C: MARY
D: Beautiful.
N: CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street.
C: GEORGE
D: And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours.
N: He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other.
C: MARY
D: Do I look as funny as you do?
C: GEORGE
D: I guess I'm not quite the football type. You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
C: MARY
D: Well, why don't you say it?
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
C: MARY
D: Eighteen.
C: GEORGE
D: Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
C: MARY
D: Too young or too old?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
N: Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on:
C: GEORGE
D: I mean, without a dress. You look older... I mean, younger. You look just...
N: In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh-oh...
C: MARY
D: Sir, my train, please.
E: holding out her hand
C: GEORGE
D: A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
N: He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm.
C: GEORGE
D: Your... your caboose, my lady.
C: MARY
D: You may kiss my hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Ummmmm...
N: Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey  hey, Mary.
N: Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals":
C: MARY
D: As I was lumbering down the street...
E: singing
N: George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street.
C: GEORGE
D: Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
C: MARY
D: Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
N: MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent.
C: GEORGE
D: No. You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass. You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY
C: MARY
D: Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
C: GEORGE
D: In that place?
C: MARY
D: Uh-huh.
C: GEORGE
D: I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch... right on the second floor there.
N: MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE George hurls the rock at the house. We hear the SOUND of a window breaking.
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass.
S: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY
C: MARY
D: What'd you wish, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know... and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long...
N: As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Are you gonna throw a rock?
N: MEDIUM LONG SHOT The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the SOUND of breaking glass.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you wish, Mary?
N: Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her.
C: MARY
D: Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight...
E: singing
N: George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street.
C: MARY AND GEORGE
D: ...can't you come out tonight, can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon.
E: singing
C: GEORGE
D: What'd you wish when you threw that rock?
N: CLOSE SHOT Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary. MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY They have stopped walking and now face one another.
C: MARY
D: Oh, no.
C: GEORGE
D: Come on, tell me.
C: MARY
D: If I told you it might not come true.
C: GEORGE
D: What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say...
N: LONG SHOT Full moon shining through the trees. BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
C: GEORGE
D: ...the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary.
C: MARY
D: I'll take it. And then what?
C: GEORGE
D: Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?
E: pauses
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH OF HOUSE As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair:
C: MAN
D: Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
N: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
C: GEORGE
D: How's that?
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH
C: MAN
D: Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
N: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
C: GEORGE
D: Want me to kiss her, huh?
N: CLOSE SHOT  PORCH OF HOUSE
C: MAN
D: Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people.
N: As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his house, slamming the front door. CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back out here, and I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...
N: Mary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes off.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary...
E: looking around
N: He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He cannot see her anywhere.
C: GEORGE
D: Okay, I give up. Where are you?
N: CLOSEUP  BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves.
C: MARY
D: Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY George walks toward the bush.
C: GEORGE
D: Here you are. Catch.
N: He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes him.
C: GEORGE
D: Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation.
C: MARY
D: Please give me my robe.
E: from the bushes
C: GEORGE
D: Hmm... A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
C: MARY
D: I'd like to have my robe.
E: impatiently
C: GEORGE
D: Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
N: Mary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say:
C: MARY
D: Ouch!
C: GEORGE
D: Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
C: MARY
D: George Bailey! Give me my robe!
E: getting mad
C: GEORGE
D: I've heard about things like this, but I've never...
C: MARY
D: Shame on you. I'm going to tell your mother on you.
E: interrupting
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, my mother's way up the corner there.
C: MARY
D: I'll call the police.
E: desperate
C: GEORGE
D: They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
C: MARY
D: I'm going to scream!
C: GEORGE
D: Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's see. No, the point is, in order to get this robe... I've got it! I'll make a deal with you, Mary.
E: thoughtfully
N: Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside him.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: George! George! Come on home, quick! Your father's had a stroke!
N: George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
C: HARRY
D: Come on, George, let's hurry.
C: GEORGE
D: Did you get a doctor?
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Yes, Campbell's there now.
N: CLOSEUP  THE HYDRANGEA BUSH As the car drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises up from the bush and follows the car with her eyes.
T: FADE OUT FADE IN:
S: EXT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN SIGN OVER ENTRANCE INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, etc. Prominently seated among them is Henry F. Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting. Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: I think that's all we'll need you for, George. I know you're anxious to make a train.
C: GEORGE
D: I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
E: rising
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
C: GEORGE
D: Thanks.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
C: POTTER
D: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose.
C: MAN
D: Wait just a minute now.
C: POTTER
D: Wait for what? I claim this institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: George, you hear what that buzzard...
E: angrily
C: LAWYER
D: Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan.
C: MAN
D: Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: Very well. In that case I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw.
N: Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.
C: GEORGE
D: Thank you very much.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
C: POTTER
D: I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
N: Everyone looks at him surprised.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
E: trying to control himself
C: POTTER
D: Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi. You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?
E: picking up papers from table
N: George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.
C: POTTER
D: A friend of yours?
E: sarcastically
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir.
C: POTTER
D: You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say...
N: George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
C: GEORGE
D: Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why... Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
C: POTTER
D: I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
C: GEORGE
D: I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
E: to the Board
N: George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy. Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man" remark was gall in his veins.
C: POTTER
D: Sentimental hogwash! I want my motion...
N: He is interrupted by a babble of talk, as the directors take up the argument
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE  BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers. He is worried about the outcome of the meeting. Dissolving the Building and Loan will alter his plans. Uncle Billy follows him around, chattering.

C: COUSIN TILLY
D: Fifty-six!
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Go on  go on. Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college too, do you?
N: Dr. Campbell comes running out, all excited.
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: George! George! They voted Potter down! They want to keep it going!
N: Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly and Uncle Billy cheer wildly. Dr. Campbell and George shake hands.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Whoopee!
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: But they've got one condition  only one condition.
C: GEORGE
D: What's that?
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
C: GEORGE
D: Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school. This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
E: emphatically
C: DR. CAMPBELL
D: But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

C: GEORGE
D: Harry, why didn't you tell somebody? What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?
E: to Ruth
C: RUTH
D: Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job.
E: smiling
N: George stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot. Harry stops with George.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Oh, he gets you and a job? Well, Harry's cup runneth over.
E: as he moves off
C: HARRY
D: George... about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George. I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back.
N: He runs out of the shot, George watching him. CLOSE SHOT George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking deeply.
C: UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
D: It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. Old, old friend of the family.
C: RUTH'S VOICE
D: Oh, of course. I've heard him speak of you.
C: UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
D: And I want to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw.

C: GEORGE
D: Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
C: VIOLET
D: Huh?
C: GEORGE
D: Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and... we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal...

C: GEORGE
D: Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
N: The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them.
C: GEORGE
D: Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why. He's picking up some bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.

E: to Mrs. Thompson, next in line
C: MRS. THOMPSON
D: But it's your own money, George.
C: GEORGE
D: Never mind about that. How much do you want?
C: MRS. THOMPSON
D: I can get along with twenty, all right.
C: GEORGE
D: Twenty dollars.
E: counting it out
C: MRS. THOMPSON
D: And I'll sign a paper.

S: INT. POTTER'S OFFICE  DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George. The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.
C: GEORGE
D: Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
C: POTTER
D: You like it? I'll send you a box.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I... I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
E: nervously
C: POTTER
D: George, now that's just what I like so much about you. George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it... or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.
E: laughs pleasantly and smoothly
C: GEORGE
D: Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
C: POTTER
D: The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight... married, making, say... forty a week.
C: GEORGE
D: Forty-five!
E: indignantly
C: POTTER
D: Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man  who hates his job  who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
C: GEORGE
D: Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?
E: mystified
C: POTTER
D: My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
C: GEORGE
D: Hire me?
E: dumbfounded
C: POTTER
D: I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
N: George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes.
C: GEORGE
D: Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars a year?
E: flabbergasted
C: POTTER
D: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
E: looking around skeptically
C: POTTER
D: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, what about the Building and Loan?
C: POTTER
D: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
C: GEORGE
D: Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?
C: POTTER
D: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
C: GEORGE
D: I'd like to do that.
C: POTTER
D: In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
C: GEORGE
D: All right, sir.
C: POTTER
D: Okay, George?
E: offers hand
C: GEORGE
D: Okay, Mr. Potter.
E: taking his hand
N: As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man. George drops his hand with a shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.
C: GEORGE
D: No... no... no... no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it! You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter! In the... in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You...
E: vehemently getting madder all the time
N: He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside Potter's wheelchair.
C: GEORGE
D: ...And that goes for you too!
N: As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr. Potter's secretary in the outer office
C: GEORGE
D: And it goes for you too!
N: WIPE TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM  GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE  NIGHT

C: POTTER'S VOICE
D: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town. Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year. Maybe to Europe once in a while.
N: George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser and stares at his reflection in the mirror.
C: GEORGE'S VOICE
D: I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm going to see the world... And I'm going to build things. I'm going to build air fields. I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm going to build a bridge a mile long.
N: While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser: INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's living room. The lettering reads: "George Lassos The Moon."
C: GEORGE'S VOICE
D: What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? If you do, just say the word; I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.
N: Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:
C: MARY
D: Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight.
E: singing
N: George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed.
C: GEORGE
D: Hi.
C: MARY
D: Hi.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
C: MARY
D: To keep from being an old maid.
C: GEORGE
D: You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
C: MARY
D: I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
C: GEORGE
D: You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you... ...Your what?
E: does a double take
C: MARY
D: My baby.
C: GEORGE
D: You mean... Mary, you on the nest?
E: incredulously
C: MARY
D: George Bailey lassos stork.

C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Yeah... yeah... maybe... maybe...
C: GEORGE
D: Maybe  maybe! I don't want any maybe. Uncle Billy, we've got to find that money!
E: shouts
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: I'm no good to you, George. I...
E: piteously
C: GEORGE
D: Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house? Someplace you could have put it? Someplace to hide the money?
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: I've been over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked ever since I lost Laura.
E: exhausted
N: Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. George grabs him by the lapels and shakes him.
C: GEORGE
D: Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! Think!
E: harshly
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: I can't think any more, George. I can't think any more. It hurts...
E: sobbing
N: George jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost maniacal.
C: GEORGE
D: Where's that money, you stupid, silly old fool? Where's the money? Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!
E: screaming at him
N: He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts at him:
C: GEORGE
D: That's what it means! One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not going to be me!
N: George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes. Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. WIPE TO:
S: INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Janie (aged eight) is seated at the piano playing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing," which she practices during the remainder of this scene. There is a Christmas tree all decorated near the fireplace. At a large table Mary is busy putting cellophane bows and decorations on gift packages. At a small table Pete (aged nine) is seated with pad and pencil in the throes of composition. On the floor Tommy (aged three) is playing with a toy vacuum cleaner. We hear the SOUND of a door open and close. Mary turns and sees George enter the hall, a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders.
S: INT. HALL  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT As George comes into the house.
C: MARY
D: Hello darling.
C: CHILDREN
D: Hello Daddy, hello daddy.

C: MARY
D: Did you bring the wreath?
C: PETE
D: Did you bring the Christmas wreath?
C: GEORGE
D: What? What wreath?
C: MARY
D: The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.
C: GEORGE
D: No. I left it at the office.
E: gruffly
C: MARY
D: Is it snowing?
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, just started.
C: MARY
D: Where's your coat and hat?
C: GEORGE
D: Left them at the office.
N: Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened.
C: MARY
D: What's the matter?
C: GEORGE
D: Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.
E: bitterly
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap. Mary is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree.
C: MARY
D: Go on, Pete, you're a big boy. You can put the star up. Way up at the top. That's it. Fill in that little bare spot right there. That's it. Isn't it wonderful about Harry? We're famous, George. I'll bet I had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet. Your mother's so excited, she...
E: to George
N: During this scene, George has been sitting in the chair, hugging Tommy to him, and crying quietly. Mary realizes that something is seriously wrong, and breaks off. Janie is thumping away at the piano.
C: GEORGE
D: Must she keep playing that?
C: JANIE
D: I have to practice for the party tonight, Daddy.
E: hurt
C: PETE
D: Mommy says we can stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.
C: TOMMY
D: Can you sing, Daddy?
C: MARY
D: Better hurry and shave. The families will be here soon.
E: to George
C: GEORGE
D: Families! I don't want the families over here!
E: rising from chair
N: Mary leads him out toward the kitchen.
C: MARY
D: Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
N: They exit with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails, and pulling at him. CAMERA PANS WITH them.

S: INT. HALL  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT As they go toward kitchen.
C: MARY
D: Have a hectic day?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, yeah, another big red letter day for the Baileys.
E: bitterly
C: PETE

C: GEORGE
D: Well, what's the matter with our car? Isn't it good enough for you?
E: turns on him
C: PETE

C: GEORGE
D: Excuse you for what?
E: annoyed
C: TOMMY
D: I burped!
C: MARY
D: All right, darling, you're excused. Now go upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants.
N: Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove.
C: GEORGE
D: Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
C: MARY
D: Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
C: GEORGE
D: What is it, a sore throat or what?
C: MARY
D: Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
C: GEORGE
D: The doctor? Was the doctor here?
C: MARY
D: Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
C: GEORGE
D: Is she running a temperature? What is it?
C: MARY
D: Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
N: George paces about the kitchen, worried.
C: GEORGE
D: Gosh, it's this old house. I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia. This drafty old barn! Might as well be living in a refrigerator. Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
C: MARY
D: George, what's wrong?
E: worried
C: GEORGE
D: Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids?
C: PETE
D: Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
E: coming in
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know. Ask your mother.
E: shouts
N: George goes toward doorway.
C: MARY
D: Where're you going?
C: GEORGE
D: Going up to see Zuzu.
N: We hear his footsteps as he leaves. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete.
C: PETE
D: He told me to write a play for tonight.
C: MARY
D: F-R-A-N-K-I-N...
S: INT. HALL  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE STARTS UP THE STAIRS The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs.
S: INT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM  NIGHT
N: FULL SHOT The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding her prize flower. George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.
C: ZUZU
D: Hi, Daddy.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, what happened to you?
C: ZUZU
D: I won a flower.
N: She starts to get out of bed.
C: GEORGE
D: Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
C: ZUZU
D: Want to give my flower a drink.
C: GEORGE
D: All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
N: She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few petals fall off. She picks them up.
C: ZUZU
D: Look, Daddy... paste it.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
N: She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu.
C: GEORGE
D: There it is, good as new.
C: ZUZU
D: Give the flower a drink.
N: George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed.
C: GEORGE
D: Now, will you do something for me?
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ZUZU They whisper.
C: ZUZU
D: What?
C: GEORGE
D: Will you try to get some sleep?
C: ZUZU
D: I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
C: GEORGE
D: I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
C: ZUZU
D: It will?
C: GEORGE
D: Uh-huh.
N: She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano. Pete is seated at the table writing. Tommy is playing with his toy vacuum cleaner. The telephone rings.
C: JANIE AND PETE
D: Telephone.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Mary comes in and picks up the phone.
C: MARY
D: I'll get it. Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.
E: on phone
N: George enters shot, and stands listening to her.
C: MARY
D: Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.
C: GEORGE
D: Is that Zuzu's teacher?
C: MARY
D: Yes.
E: hand over receiver
C: GEORGE
D: Let me speak to her.
N: He snatches the phone from Mary.
C: GEORGE
D: Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway? What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked? Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
E: on phone
C: MARY
D: George!
E: shocked
N: She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice sputtering with protest.
C: GEORGE
D: Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for  to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes...
N: Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Aw, that stupid...
N: Mary speaks quickly in to the phone.
C: MARY
D: Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize... hello... hello... She's hung up.
E: to George
C: GEORGE
D: I'll hang her up!
E: savagely
N: But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling:
C: MR. WELCH'S VOICE
D: Now, who do you think you are?
N: George hears this and grabs the receiver from Mary.
C: GEORGE
D: Wait a minute. Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch? Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.
E: to Mary on phone
N: Mary once more tries to take the phone from him.
C: MARY
D: George...
C: GEORGE
D: Will you get out and let me handle this? Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh? Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you think you're man enough... Hello? Any...
E: raving at her into phone  shouting
N: But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh...
N: He hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room. His face is flushed and wet.
C: PETE
D: Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"?
C: GEORGE
D: How should I know? What do you think I am, a dictionary?
E: shouts
N: He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner.
C: GEORGE
D: Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
N: Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously.
C: GEORGE
D: Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet? You've played it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!
E: savagely
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. The three children are crying.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... you go on and practice. Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm sorry. What do you want to know?
E: gasping for breath
C: PETE
D: Nothing, Daddy.
E: holding back his tears
N: Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst. There is silence in the room.
C: GEORGE
D: What's the matter with everybody? Janie, go on. I told you to practice. Now, go on, play!
E: shouts
N: Janie breaks into sobs.
C: JANIE
D: Oh, Daddy...
C: MARY
D: George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...
E: in an outburst
N: The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary...
N: He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house. Mary goes to the phone, picks it up.
C: MARY
D: Bedford, two-four-seven, please.
C: PETE
D: Is Daddy in trouble?
C: JANIE
D: Shall I pray for him?
C: MARY
D: Yes, Janie, pray very hard.
C: TOMMY
D: Me, too?
C: MARY
D: You too, Tommy. Hello, Uncle Billy?
E: on phone
N: WIPE TO:
S: INT. POTTER'S OFFICE IN BANK  NIGHT  8:00 P.M.
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner's up there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.
C: POTTER
D: Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
E: casually
C: GEORGE
D: The reporters?
E: incredulous
C: POTTER
D: Yes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you.
C: GEORGE
D: Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan... any interest. If you still want the Building and Loan, why I...
E: desperate
C: POTTER
D: George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
E: interrupting
C: GEORGE
D: No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere.
C: POTTER
D: You misplaced eight thousand dollars?
E: looking up
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir.
C: POTTER
D: Have you notified the police?
C: GEORGE
D: No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
C: POTTER
D: They're going to believe that one. What've you been doing, George? Playing the market with the company's money?
E: snorts
C: GEORGE
D: No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
C: POTTER
D: What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
C: GEORGE
D: What?
E: incredulous
C: POTTER
D: Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
C: GEORGE
D: I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
C: POTTER
D: Well, what about all your other friends?
C: GEORGE
D: They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
C: POTTER
D: I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
C: GEORGE
D: No, sir.
E: shaking his head
C: POTTER
D: Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?
C: GEORGE
D: I have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy.
E: pulls out policy
C: POTTER
D: Yes... how much is your equity in it?
C: GEORGE
D: Five hundred dollars.
C: POTTER
D: Look at you. You used to be so cocky! You were going to go out and conquer the world! You once called me a warped, frustrated old man. What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities  no stocks  no bonds  nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy. You're worth more dead than alive. Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail... But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds  manipulation  malfeasance...
E: sarcastically
N: George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials.
C: POTTER
D: All right, George, go ahead. You can't hide in a little town like this.
N: George is out of the door by now. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Potter.
C: POTTER
D: Bill? This is Potter.
E: on phone
S: EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off.
S: EXT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall.
S: INT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.
C: MARTINI'S VOICE
D: Merry Christmas. Glad you came.
E: greeting new customers
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: How about some of that good spaghetti?
C: MARTINI'S VOICE
D: We got everything.
N: During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of beer. George is mumbling:
C: GEORGE
D: God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God.
C: NICK
D: Are you all right, George? Want someone to take you home?
E: friendly
N: George shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side.
C: MARTINI
D: Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.
E: worried
N: The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts sharply to the name "Bailey."
C: MAN
D: Bailey? Which Bailey?
C: NICK
D: This is Mr. George Bailey.
N: Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several others rush to pick him up.
C: MAN
D: And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse. She cried for an hour. It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out...
E: to George
C: MARTINI
D: You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
E: furious
N: Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money.
C: WELCH
D: Now wait... I want to pay for my drink.
C: MARTINI
D: Never mind the money. You get out of here quick.
C: WELCH
D: All right.
C: MARTINI
D: You hit my best friend. Get out!
N: Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding.
C: NICK
D: You all right, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Who was that?
E: stunned
C: MARTINI
D: He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
C: MARTINI
D: The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
C: NICK
D: Yes, you bet.
C: GEORGE
D: Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here...
E: finds it in pocket
N: He starts for the door.
C: MARTINI
D: Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm all right.
N: Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off.
C: MARTINI
D: Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm all right.
C: MARTINI
D: Please don't go away  please!
N: George opens the door and exits to the street. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out.
C: OWNER
D: What do you think you're doing?
N: CLOSE SHOT George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages.
C: OWNER
D: Now look what you did. My greatgrandfather planted this tree.
E: with indignation
N: George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man.
C: OWNER
D: Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here, you drunken fool! Get this car out of here!
S: EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM LONG SHOT George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him.
C: DRIVER
D: Hey, what's the matter with you? Look where you're going!
N: The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing. CLOSE SHOT George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard.
S: EXT. RIVER  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN from George's angle TO the water, dotted with floating ice, passing under the bridge.
S: EXT. BRIDGE AT RAILING  NIGHT
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified.
C: VOICE
D: Help! Help!
E: from river
N: George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. CLOSER ANGLE George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man.
C: MAN
D: Help! Help! Help!
S: EXT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below.
S: EXT. RIVER  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore. WIPE TO:
S: INT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter underwear. He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems. Clarence is standing on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees. The tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or says. Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper.
C: CLARENCE
D: I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. My wife gave me this on my last birthday. I passed away in it.
N: The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now.
N: The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.
C: TOLLKEEPER
D: How'd you happen to fall in?
C: CLARENCE
D: I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George.
N: George looks up, surprised.
C: GEORGE
D: You what? To save me?
C: CLARENCE
D: Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
C: GEORGE
D: Go through with what?
C: CLARENCE
D: Suicide.
N: George and the tollkeeper react to this.
C: TOLLKEEPER
D: It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
C: CLARENCE
D: Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
C: TOLLKEEPER
D: Where do you come from?
N: He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next statement.
C: CLARENCE
D: Heaven. I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
E: to George
N: The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.
C: GEORGE
D: Very funny.
E: offhand
C: CLARENCE
D: Your lip's bleeding, George.
N: George's hand goes to his mouth.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to your prayer. That's why I was sent down here.
E: comes around to George
C: GEORGE
D: How do you know my name?
E: casually interested
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
C: GEORGE
D: What are you, a mind reader or something?
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, no.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, who are you, then?
C: CLARENCE
D: Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
C: GEORGE
D: Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
C: CLARENCE
D: Angel, Second Class.
N: The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on two legs. Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest cop.
C: CLARENCE
D: Cheerio, my good man.
E: to tollkeeper
N: George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks?
N: He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me?
C: CLARENCE
D: That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
C: GEORGE
D: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
C: CLARENCE
D: Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah... just things like that. Now how'd you know that?
E: bewildered
C: CLARENCE
D: I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
C: CLARENCE
D: I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
C: GEORGE
D: Sure, sure. How?
E: humoring him
C: CLARENCE
D: By letting me help you.
C: GEORGE
D: Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, tut, tut, tut.
C: GEORGE
D: I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
C: CLARENCE
D: Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you...
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
E: interrupts annoyed with Clarence
C: CLARENCE
D: No, you don't understand. I've got my job...
C: GEORGE
D: Aw, shut up, will you.
E: savagely
N: Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces across the room, thoughtfully.
C: CLARENCE
D: Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy. So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
E: to himself to George
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.
E: dejectedly
C: CLARENCE
D: What'd you say?
C: GEORGE
D: I said I wish I'd never been born.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You... ...wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
E: gets an idea glances up toward Heaven to George
N: As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.
C: CLARENCE
D: You don't have to make all that fuss about it.
E: looking upward
N: As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what Clarence has said.
C: GEORGE
D: What did you say?
C: CLARENCE
D: You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
N: George feels his ear as Clarence talks.
C: CLARENCE
D: No worries  no obligations  no eight thousand dollars to get  no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE George indicates his bad ear.
C: GEORGE
D: Say something else in that ear.
C: CLARENCE
D: Sure. You can hear out of it.
E: bending down
C: GEORGE
D: Well, that's the doggonedest thing... I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
C: CLARENCE
D: Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
N: George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you know about that... What's happened?
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
D: George looks around, as though to get his bearings.
C: GEORGE
D: It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...
E: standing up
C: CLARENCE
D: Our clothes are dry.
N: George feels the clothes on the line.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get...
N: They start dressing. George interrupts himself.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
C: CLARENCE
D: I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
C: GEORGE
D: You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
N: WIPE TO:
S: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT This is the same empty street where George's car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.
C: CLARENCE
D: What's the matter?
C: GEORGE
D: Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here.
E: puzzled
C: CLARENCE
D: You have no car.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
N: CLOSE SHOT  AT CURB The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm.
C: OWNER
D: Good evening.
E: politely
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?
C: OWNER
D: I beg your pardon?
C: GEORGE
D: My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
C: OWNER
D: What tree?
C: GEORGE
D: What do you mean, what tree? This tree. Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here.
N: The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.
C: OWNER
D: You must mean two other trees. You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
C: GEORGE
D: Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford Falls.
E: blankly
C: OWNER
D: I mean Pottersville. Don't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you?
E: sharply
N: The owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely bewildered.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is... ...or you are!
E: to Clarence
C: CLARENCE
D: It isn't me!
C: GEORGE
D: Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
N: He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the road.
C: CLARENCE
D: Clarence!
E: as they go
C: GEORGE
D: Clarence! Clarence!
N: WIPE TO:
S: INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up to the bar.
C: GEORGE
D: That's all right. Go on in. Martini's a good friend of mine.
E: as they come in
N: Two people leave the bar as they approach.
C: GEORGE
D: There's a place to sit down. Sit down.
C: MEDIUM CLOSEUP
D: Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
C: NICK
D: You want a martini?
C: GEORGE
D: No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
C: NICK
D: Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you?
E: impatient
C: GEORGE
D: Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
C: NICK
D: Okay. What's yours?
E: to Clarence
C: CLARENCE
D: I was just thinking... It's been so long since I...
E: face puckers up with delicious anticipation
C: NICK
D: Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
E: impatient
C: CLARENCE
D: That's a good man. I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not cold enough for that. Not nearly cold enough... Wait a minute... wait a minute... I got it. Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
E: appreciatively
C: NICK
D: Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast. And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear? Or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
N: As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by this conduct.
C: CLARENCE
D: What's he talking about?
E: to George
C: GEORGE
D: Nick  Nick, just give him the same as mine. He's okay.
E: soothingly
C: NICK
D: Okay.
N: Nick turns away to get the drinks.
C: GEORGE
D: What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
C: CLARENCE
D: You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
C: CLARENCE
D: No.
C: GEORGE
D: You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
N: Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.
C: CLARENCE
D: No.
C: GEORGE
D: No wonder you jumped in the river.
C: CLARENCE
D: I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
N: Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, that's right.
N: A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the SOUND of the bell.
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
C: GEORGE
D: Made what?
C: CLARENCE
D: Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
N: George glances up at Nick.
C: GEORGE
D: Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
C: CLARENCE
D: Why? Don't they believe in angels?
C: GEORGE
D: A... Yeah, but... you know...
E: looking at Nick
C: CLARENCE
D: Then why should they be surprised when they see one?
C: GEORGE
D: He never grew up. He's... How old are you, anyway, Clarence?
E: to Nick to Clarence
C: CLARENCE
D: Two hundred and ninety-three... ...next May.
E: thinks
N: Nick slams the bottle down on the counter.
C: NICK
D: That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
C: GEORGE
D: Look, Nick. What's wrong?
C: NICK
D: And that's another thing. Where do you come off calling me Nick?
E: angrily
C: GEORGE
D: Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
C: NICK
D: What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox. Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
E: sees someone come in
N: CLOSE SHOT A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand. CLOSEUP  GEORGE He can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist. BACK TO SHOT  NICK AT THE BAR
C: NICK
D: Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here?
E: to Gower
N: Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face. CLOSE SHOT George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
C: GOWER
D: No. No.
C: NICK
D: Throw him out. Throw him out.
E: to his bouncers
N: The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
E: bewildered
C: NICK
D: You know, that's another reason for me not to like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. Would you show these gentlemen to the door.
E: to his bouncers
C: BOUNCER
D: Sure. This way, gentlemen.
S: EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow.
S: INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.
C: NICK
D: Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!
S: EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other.
C: CLARENCE
D: You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the...
C: GEORGE
D: What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly...
N: George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" instead of "MARTINI'S." George and Clarence get to their feet.
C: GEORGE
D: What the... hey, what's going on around here? Why, this ought to be Martini's place.
E: exasperated
N: He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look.
C: GEORGE
D: Look, who are you?
C: CLARENCE
D: I told you, George. I'm your guardian angel.
E: patiently
N: George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm. It's flesh.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist?
C: CLARENCE
D: No, of course not.
C: GEORGE
D: Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
C: CLARENCE
D: Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
C: GEORGE
D: Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
C: CLARENCE
D: You're nobody. You have no identity.
N: George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
C: CLARENCE
D: There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy... George looks in his watch pocket.
E: he says these things as George searches for them
C: CLARENCE
D: They're not there, either.
C: GEORGE
D: What?
C: CLARENCE
D: Zuzu's petals.
N: George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out.
C: CLARENCE
D: You've been given a great gift, George. A chance to see what the world would be like without you.
N: George is completely befuddled.
C: GEORGE
D: Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home.
E: shaking his head
N: He starts off. Clarence rises.
C: CLARENCE
D: Home? What home?
C: GEORGE
D: Now shut up! Cut it out! You're... you're... you're crazy! That's what I think... you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone!
E: furious
N: George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.
C: CLARENCE
D: How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. No, I didn't have a drink!
E: pause
N: WIPE TO:
S: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on. CLOSE SHOT George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan. There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:
C: GEORGE
D: Hey... hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
C: COP
D: The Building and what?
C: GEORGE
D: The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
C: COP
D: They went out of business years ago.
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, Violet! Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
E: to the cop
C: COP
D: I know. I know.
C: GEORGE
D: I know that girl!
N: The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, Ernie  Ernie!
S: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.
C: GEORGE
D: Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!
C: ERNIE
D: Where do you live?
E: a much harder Ernie
C: GEORGE
D: Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
C: ERNIE
D: Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?...
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
C: ERNIE
D: All right. He pulls down the flag on the meter and starts the cab.
S: INT. CAB  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE Ernie is puzzled by the stranger.
C: GEORGE
D: Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here. I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me now. Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?
C: ERNIE
D: You seen my wife?
E: suspiciously
C: GEORGE
D: Seen your wife? I've been to your house a hundred times.
E: exasperated
C: ERNIE
D: Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid... And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
C: GEORGE
D: Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
N: Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger. As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. Bert gets into his car and follows. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM LONG SHOT The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house.
C: ERNIE
D: Is this the place?
C: GEORGE
D: Of course it's the place.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
S: EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house. Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.
S: EXT. CAB  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and Ernie stand watching George's actions.
C: BERT
D: What's up, Ernie?
C: ERNIE
D: I don't know, but we better keep an eye on this guy. He's bats.
N: Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the beam toward the old house.
S: INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:
C: GEORGE
D: Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you?
N: Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.
C: CLARENCE
D: They're not here, George. You have no children.
C: GEORGE
D: Where are you? What have you done with them?
E: ignoring him then, to Clarence
S: INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.
C: BERT
D: All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
C: GEORGE
D: Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
N: He rushes toward Bert.
C: BERT
D: Stand back.
C: GEORGE
D: Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
C: ERNIE
D: Watch him, Bert.
E: warningly
C: BERT
D: Come on, come on.
C: GEORGE
D: Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys? You were here on my wedding night. You, both of you, stood out here on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember?
E: bewildered
C: ERNIE
D: Think I'd better be going.
E: nervously
C: BERT
D: Look, now why don't you be a good kid and we'll take you in to a doctor. Everything's going to be all right.
N: Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George struggles with him, trying to explain.
C: GEORGE
D: Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
E: gesturing to Clarence
C: BERT
D: I hate to do this, fella.
N: Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, forcing him to let George go.
C: CLARENCE
D: Run... George! Run, George!
N: George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on Clarence.
C: CLARENCE
D: Help! Joseph, help!
C: BERT
D: Oh, shut up!
C: CLARENCE
D: Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!
N: Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert gets up, amazed by his vanishing.
C: BERT
D: Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here.
N: Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright.
C: ERNIE
D: I need a drink.
E: stammering
N: He runs out of the scene.
C: BERT
D: Well, which way'd they go? Help me find 'em.
S: EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: "Ma Bailey's Boarding House." MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him.
C: MA BAILEY
D: Well?
C: GEORGE
D: Mother...
C: MA BAILEY
D: Mother? What do you want?
N: It is a cruel blow to George.
C: GEORGE
D: Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me.
C: MA BAILEY
D: George who? If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy.
E: coldly
N: She starts to close the door, but George stops her.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
C: MA BAILEY
D: Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
E: desperate
C: MA BAILEY
D: You know him?
E: suspiciously
C: GEORGE
D: Well, sure I do.
C: MA BAILEY
D: When'd you see him last?
C: GEORGE
D: Today, over at the house.
C: MA BAILEY
D: That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
N: She slams the door shut in George's face.
S: EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.
C: CLARENCE
D: Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
C: GEORGE
D: I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something. Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know how, too. I... the last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini.
E: quietly, trying to use logic
C: CLARENCE
D: You know where he lives?
C: GEORGE
D: Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
N: They walk out of scene. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be.
C: CLARENCE
D: Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
N: The two walk into the cemetery.
C: CLARENCE
D: You weren't here to build them.
E: as they go
N: CLOSE MOVING SHOT George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at: CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY  1911-1919" CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE
C: CLARENCE
D: Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
N: George jumps up.
C: GEORGE
D: That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
C: CLARENCE
D: Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
E: sadly
N: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE
C: GEORGE
D: Clarence...
C: CLARENCE
D: Yes, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Where's Mary?
C: CLARENCE
D: Oh, well, I can't...
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
N: George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.
C: CLARENCE
D: I...

E: to himself
N: WIPE TO:
S: EXT. LIBRARY  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different  no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life. Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self- satisfied and efficient. CLOSEUP George, as he watches her. CLOSE SHOT George and Mary, on the sidewalk.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary!
N: She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues on.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary!
N: Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary! Mary!
N: He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary, it's George! Don't you know me? What's happened to us?
C: MARY
D: I don't know you! Let me go!
E: struggling
C: GEORGE
D: Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me. Please, Mary, help me. Where's our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me, Mary!
N: Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar.
S: INT. BLUE MOON  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming. The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary... Let me go! Mary, don't run away!
E: shouting to men holding him
C: MAN
D: Somebody call the police!
C: ANOTHER MAN
D: Hit him with a bottle!
C: ANOTHER MAN
D: He needs a strait jacket!
C: MARY
D: That man  stop him!
E: from back of room
C: GEORGE
D: Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!
E: recognizing some of them
N: Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar.
C: GEORGE
D: Mary!
C: MAN
D: Oh, no you don't!
C: GEORGE
D: Mary!
E: screaming
N: George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperately he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.
C: GEORGE
D: Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?
S: EXT. SIDEWALK  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into George as he comes out.
C: BERT
D: Oh, it's you!
N: He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the button, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.
C: BERT
D: Stand back!
E: to crowd
N: Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT The same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is frantically looking for Clarence.
C: GEORGE
D: Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. Get me back. Get me back. I don't care what happens to me. Only get me back to my wife and kids. Help me, Clarence, please! Please! I want to live again!
N: CLOSEUP George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.
C: GEORGE
D: I want to live again. I want to live again. Please, God, let me live again.
N: George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall. CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE SOBBING AT THE RAILING The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into scene.
C: BERT
D: Hey, George! George! You all right?
N: George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again.
C: BERT
D: Hey, what's the matter?
C: GEORGE
D: Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out!
E: warningly
C: BERT
D: What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Don't... George?
N: George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly  George's mouth is bleeding again.
C: GEORGE
D: Bert, do you know me?
C: BERT
D: Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
C: GEORGE
D: What did...
N: George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds.
C: GEORGE
D: My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's bleed... Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're... they're here, Bert! What do you know about that? Merry Christmas!
E: joyously feeling in watch pocket
N: He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town.
C: LONG SHOT
D: George runs away from camera yelling
C: GEORGE
D: Mary! Mary!
N: WIPE TO:
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign.
C: GEORGE
D: Hello, Bedford Falls!
N: He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the street

S: INT. ENTRANCE HALL  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door.
C: GEORGE

S: INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree.
C: MARY
D: Come on in here now. Now, you stand right over here, by the tree. Right there, and don't move, don't move. I hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!
N: She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in. He is followed by Ernie, and about twenty more townspeople.
C: MARY
D: Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In here!
N: Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room. A table stands in front of George. George picks up Zuzu to protect her from the mob. Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of money out onto the table  the money overflows and falls all over.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Isn't it wonderful?
N: The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and smiles. Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table  pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins. Tears course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets them.
C: UNCLE BILLY
D: Mary did it, George! Mary did it! She told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money. They didn't ask any questions  just said: "If George is in trouble  count on me." You never saw anything like it.

N: Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes.

N: Mr. Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes.
C: ERNIE
D: Mr. Gower!

D: I made the rounds of my charge accounts.

N: Violet Bick arrives, and takes out the money George had given her for her trip to New York.
C: GEORGE
D: Violet Bick!
C: VIOLET
D: I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
N: Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long black stocking.
C: ANNIE
D: I've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever I get a husband.
N: Mr. Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor.

D: Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. Quiet  quiet. Now, this is from London. Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop. My office instructed to advance you up to twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas. Sam Wainwright.
E: reading
N: The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on top of the pile of money on the table.
C: MARY
D: Mr. Martini. How about some wine?
E: calling out
N: As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, accompanied by Bert, the cop.
C: HARRY
D: Hello, George, how are you?
C: GEORGE
D: Harry... Harry...
C: HARRY
D: Mary  looks like I got here too late.
E: as he sees the money
C: BERT
D: Mary, I got him here from the airport as quickly as I could. The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.
N: Mrs. Bailey enters scene.
C: MRS. BAILEY
D: Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.
N: Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.
C: HARRY
D: Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my big brother, George. The richest man in town!
N: Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld Lang syne," and everyone joins in. CLOSE SHOT George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."
C: MARY
D: What's that?
E: looking at book
C: GEORGE
D: That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.
N: At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the bell.
C: ZUZU
D: Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.
C: GEORGE
D: That's right, that's right.
E: smiling
N: He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.
C: GEORGE
D: Attaboy, Clarence.
N: The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo for the
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
