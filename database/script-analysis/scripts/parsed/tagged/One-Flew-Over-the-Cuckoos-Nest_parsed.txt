S: EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL
N: All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains, rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight. A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn elsewhere and he looks down. REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look up at McMurphy. McMURPHY As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.
C: MAN
D: McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle, from the infirmary. Can you hear me?
E: V.O. through bullhorn
N: McMurphy doesn't respond.
C: SHANKLE
D: Can you hear me, McMurphy?
E: V.O. through bullhorn
N: McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.
C: SECOND VOICE
D: Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ sake, he ain't gonna come down... you...
E: through bullhorn
N: The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against the coming night when...
C: SHANKLE
D: McMurphy! I have the warden's promise. If you come down, nobody will hurt you! You'll be in my custody! I promise!
E: V.O. through bullhorn
N: An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN
N: Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls. The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc. Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off duty. The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns, another twists, a third lies as if dead. CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open, very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing. A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake. Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and disappear into a side room. Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in, passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses' station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy preparing the day's medication. Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden freezes. Terrified.
C: MILLER
D: Where you goin', Chief?
C: WARREN
D: You goin' t'see the Big White Fathuh?
C: WASHINGTON
D: He goin' t'see the Big White Muthuh...
N: They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic spreading across his face.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat apples off my head an' he mine me like a baby...
E: CONT'D
N: A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns, along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE enters the ward.
C: THREE ATTENDANTS
D: Mornin', Miss Ratched...
E: simultaneously, as Big Nurse passes
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good morning, boys.
N: She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the wall, mop in hand.
S: INT. NURSES' STATION
N: as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears an enormous cross between her breasts.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday... Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine.
E: she flips on the intercom
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY
N: as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of bed.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Time to get up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up!
E: V.O. through loudspeaker
N: The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes, who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the patients toward the washroom. Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up his mattress.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love... Good morning, Mister Harding... Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon...
N: Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Oh, Mister Bromden... Mister Washington!
E: CONT'D calling out
N: Washington comes running.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Yes, Miss Ratched?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Yes, Miss Ratched...
E: taking Bromden by the hand
S: INT. WASHROOM - DAY
N: The patients are busy washing and shaving. Warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington guides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an antique barber chair stands.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Warren!
E: calling as he goes
N: He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns away.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Get your black ass in here!
E: CONT'D shouting out
N: Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.
C: WARREN
D: Tha's it... be right back!
N: Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
N: BROMDEN as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by, checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their cups with orange juice. The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window. Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45 record player with a stack of records, then she settles down to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day Room. The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself, rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to the wall by imaginary nails. Bromden is pushing a mop around. Washington, Warren and Miller are in the men's dorm making up the Chronics' beds when O.S. the TELEPHONE RINGS.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY
N: as Miss Pilbow picks up the phone.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Eighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking... Yes... ... New admission, Miss Ratched...
E: she makes a note and hangs it
N: Miss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then turns and flips the intercom on.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Mister Washington! Mister Warren!
E: CONT'D over loudspeaker
N: She exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAY ROOM
N: as Miss Pilbow exits nurses' station and heads down the hallway, Washington and Warren on her heels. Miller looking wistfully after them.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY SHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND DEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to First Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the rear door to the car.
C: DEPUTY SHERIFF
D: Okay, let's go.
E: to an unseen occupant
N: A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.
C: DEPUTY SHERIFF
D: Let's move it...
E: CONT'D
N: McMurphy goes up the stairs, followed by the Deputy, and crosses into the building.
S: INT. MAIN BUILDING - DAY
N: as McMurphy enters the building followed by the Deputies, where Nurse Pilbow, McMurphy's folder in hand, and Washington and Warren stand waiting -- all in a pleasant, receptive mood. First Deputy hands McMurphy's gym bag to Washington, who hands it to Warren.
C: SECOND DEPUTY
D: Okay, this is it!
N: McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed, McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and plants a kiss on his forehead.
C: SECOND DEPUTY
D: Jesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.
E: CONT'D squirming out of McMurphy's grasp
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, ain't that the truth.
C: DEPUTY SHERIFF
D: He's all yours, Miss.
E: to Miss Pilbow
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Thank you, Officer...
N: The two Deputies start down the stairs.
C: MCMURPHY
D: So long, fellas...
N: The two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who takes a deep breath of fresh air.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
E: CONT'D
C: MISS PILBOW
D: This way, Mister McMurphy.

C: MCMURPHY
D: I tell ya, these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning, last night at the jail, and I swear they'd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they could've found the facilities...

E: CONT'D to Nurse Pilbow
C: MISS PILBOW
D: I'm sure you will.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
E: to Nurse Pilbow
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Oh...
N: They arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door and opens it as...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day observation period. Short-timer, like they say...
N: Soft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Of course. Mister McMurphy.
E: indicating door
C: MCMURPHY
D: After you, ma'am.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Thank you.
N: Nurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with security gate which she opens.

E: O.S.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WARD - DAY
N: as McMurphy, Spivey, Washington and Warren cross the visitors' area towards Nurse Pilbow, who stands holding the security gate open. At the far end of the hallway, which opens into the day room, patients can be seen.
C: SPIVEY
D: Oh, what's that?
E: to McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
C: SPIVEY
D: Oh, do you do much fishing?
N: As they pass through the security gate:
C: MCMURPHY
D: Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a nickel for every fish I landed between Point Conception and the Alaska coast...
N: Washington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful distance.
C: SPIVEY
D: Is that so?
E: to McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.

D: Doc, my gungs hurt me.
E: approaching and pointing to his mouth
N: Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: This way, Mister McMurphy.
N: As McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow down the hall, Spivey's voice trails after him.
C: SPIVEY
D: Have you been taking your Dilantin, Jim?
E: O.S.
C: SEFELT
D: Uh-huh...
E: O.S.
C: SPIVEY
D: Well, we'll send you over to the dentist and see what he can do. Okay?

E: O.S.
N: McMurphy and Nurse Pilbow reach the day room.
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Thank you, ma'am,
N: Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among other bits of information, READS:
S: TODAY IS MONDAY SEPTEMBER 30, 1963. THE NEXT MEAL IS LUNCH. THE NEXT HOLIDAY IS HALLOWEEN.
N: Another notice READS: SIGN UP NOW! BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT STAFF VS PATIENTS. Washington, Warren, Miller There are no other names listed. Sefelt passes by.
C: MCMURPHY

E: CONT'D
C: SEFELT
D: Hi.
N: Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson, who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: as McMurphy drifts into the room and looks around. The room is as it was. The MUSIC ENDS. There is a CLICK. McMurphy's attention is drawn to the nurses' station. McMURPHY'S POV OF NURSES' STATION where Miss Pilbow is SEEN through a large plate glass window, busy typing a nameplate for McMurphy. Big Nurse, her back to McMurphy, is turning over a stack of records. She presses the phonograph button. A record falls on the turntable and MUSIC BEGINS as she turns and sees McMurphy. ANOTHER ANGLE McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. Big Nurse looks up and studies him. McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.
C: MCMURPHY
D: How ya doin', buddy?
C: PATIENT
D: Poorly, thank you.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, buddy?
E: CONT'D
C: TABER
D: Are you a doctor?

E: CONT'D
C: MARTINI

D: How do ya know that?
C: TABER
D: Because I quit breathing.
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: You're breathin' right now.
N: Taber walks away. McMurphy watches him go. Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What's that, Pop?
E: crossing to him
N: The old man squeaks again.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Can't hear ya, old-timer.
E: leaning in close
C: OLD VEGETABLE
D: Ain't this a pisser?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club.
N: McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the game.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Whatcha boys playin'?
C: BILLY
D: H-H-Hearts.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.

C: HARDING
D: What are you doing?
E: to McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm seeing what a busy man does.
N: Harding, very nervous at McMurphy's proximity, turns back to the game.

D: No!
C: HARDING
D: Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
E: slamming his cards
N: Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his pride as he goes. McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the cards in.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yessir, that's why I came to this establishment for, to bring you birds fun and entertainment 'round the gamin' table...
N: McMurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table. Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement -- he's a card shark, a magician -- leaving the Acutes with their mouths hanging open.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy!
E: O.S.

D: Mister Miller, this is Mister McMurphy, who'll be staying with us.
E: CONT'D
N: Greetings are exchanged as they pass through.
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY
N: as Big Nurse and McMurphy cross down the aisle.
C: BIG NURSE
D: We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Thank you, ma'am...
N: Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the mattress down.
C: BIG NURSE
D: This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yes, ma'am...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
C: MCMURPHY

C: BIG NURSE
D: All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
C: MCMURPHY

N: They cross out of the men's dorm. Big Nurse watches them go.
C: SPIVEY
D: What other work have you done?
E: V.O.
S: INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate: JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers. McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue clothes, sits facing him.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
C: SPIVEY
D: Oh, what was that?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Poker!
C: SPIVEY
D: I see.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
C: SPIVEY
D: In what way?
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
C: SPIVEY
D: I see...
C: MCMURPHY
D: To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
C: SPIVEY
D: Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
E: indicating his papers
C: SPIVEY
D: Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' What do you think of that report?
E: looking over papers looking up at McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: I don't, Doc...
C: SPIVEY
D: Arrested on an assault charge five times...
E: goes back to papers
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's correct, Doc ...
C: SPIVEY
D: The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
E: reading from folder
C: MCMURPHY
D: Doc, what can I tell ya?
C: SPIVEY
D: Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
C: MCMURPHY
D: No, this is my first trip, Doc.
C: SPIVEY
D: Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
E: closes folder and sits back
C: MCMURPHY
D: You bet, Doc!
C: SPIVEY
D: Good. Good.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair, doing a deep breathing exercise. The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and forth.
C: BANCINI
D: I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting.
E: busy with her papers
N: Billy does... gently laying a hand on Bancini.
C: BILLY
D: T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Pete...
C: BANCINI
D: Awful tired...
N: Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee.
C: BIG NURSE
D: At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
E: reading from logbook
C: HARDING
D: Yes, that's perfectly correct.
C: BIG NURSE
D: He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
E: reading she closes book
N: Big Nurse waits. A long beat. Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost wanting someone to begin. The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions. McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse or the Aides have noticed. If they have, no one pays any attention. McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis, unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet. The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each other quizzically. Big Nurse merely watches. McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.
E: no response
C: BILLY
D: M-m-m-ma'am?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Would you like to start?
C: BILLY
D: N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Sefelt?
N: Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Fredrickson?
E: CONT'D
N: Fredrickson passes.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Taber?
E: CONT'D
N: Taber passes.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Martini?
E: CONT'D
C: MARTINI
D: No!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Scanlon?
N: Scanlon looks at the floor.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Cheswick?
E: CONT'D
N: Cheswick wags his head 'no.'
C: BIG NURSE
D: Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
E: CONT'D no response; she focuses in on Harding
C: HARDING
D: Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
C: BIG NURSE
D: But you have no proof.
C: HARDING
D: No, Miss Ratched...
C: BIG NURSE
D: And yet you suspect her.
C: HARDING
D: Yes, that is correct.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Why?
C: HARDING
D: I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
N: One of the Chronics laughs like a child.
C: HARDING
D: Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
C: SEFELT
D: What's he talkin' about?
C: TABER
D: Yeah, Harding, why don't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point.
N: Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.
C: HARDING
D: The point is, I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content.
N: Several hands go up.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes, Billy?
C: BILLY
D: I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
C: TABER
D: Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin' dumb I can't believe it.
C: HARDING
D: That's a matter of opinion.
C: SEFELT
D: Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Through the ass.
N: Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the others laugh.
C: HARDING
D: Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?
E: smarting
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Now what would I be trying to say?
E: innocence itself
C: HARDING
D: I don't know. I don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Peculiar?
C: SEFELT
D: Why?
C: TABER
D: Yeah, why?
C: SCANLON
D: Yeah, tell us why.
C: HARDING
D: I hesitate to go on.
C: BIG NURSE
D: No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
C: HARDING
D: I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
C: HARDING
D: ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence...
E: CONT'D his voice rising as he goes on
C: TABER
D: You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose!
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Yeah, wise up, Harding.
C: SEFELT
D: Yeah, turn her loose!
T: ACUTES
N: (start pouring it on) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs...
C: RUCKLY
D: Ffffffuck da wife...
E: chiming in
C: BANCINI
D: Tired... Awful tired...
E: wagging his head
T: ACUTES
N: (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert.
C: BANCINI
D: I'm tired!
E: in a strong angry voice
N: Everyone hushes.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Somebody see to Mister Bancini.
N: Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he isn't to be hushed.
C: BANCINI
D: Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...
N: Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable. Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses' station. Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.
C: WASHINGTON
D: You a good boy, Mistah Bancini...
N: Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. Pete turns to his fellow inmates.
C: BANCINI
D: You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney...
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm...
C: BANCINI
D: That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't...
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Yes, I know, I know...
E: working her way around Bancini
N: She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.
C: BANCINI
D: ... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard... Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired...
E: starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying
N: McMurphy looks around at the others. Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to Bancini's state.
S: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
N: WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court, which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere. Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.
C: MARTINI
D: Catch it! Catch it!
E: as he throws ball
N: The ball rolls to the corner.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!
C: MARTINI
D: No!
N: Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after the ball, when Martini goes running after it.
C: MARTINI
D: I get it! I get it!
E: CONT'D
N: But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to the ball. Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon out. The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a prison yard. Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding, who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
C: HARDING
D: A pecking party?
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
C: HARDING AND CHESWICK
D: Who? Who?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who...
N: The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.
C: HARDING
D: It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
C: HARDING
D: Did to me?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
C: BILLY
D: Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
C: MCMURPHY
D: What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: It's the questions she asks.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
C: HARDING
D: Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
C: MCMURPHY
D: She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
E: as calm as blue waters
N: McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on his toes.
C: MCMURPHY
D: She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls.
N: Harding is doubled over.
C: SEFELT
D: That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
C: MCMURPHY
D: P.A. What the hell is that?
C: SEFELT
D: Potential assaultive.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Huh?
C: HARDING
D: Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
C: HARDING
D: And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: What for?
C: HARDING
D: Lobotomy!
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Lobotomy?
C: HARDING
D: That!
E: CONT'D pointing to lobotomy case
N: McMurphy looks. SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his forehead. McMURPHY As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to his feet and he picks it up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
E: to Harding
C: HARDING
D: Now, what would I be trying to say?
N: Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.
C: SCANLON
D: Gimme the ball!
C: MARTINI
D: No. Me! Me!
C: WASHINGTON
D: Pass the ball, McMurphy.
E: O.S.
N: McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes. When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back over his shoulder to Martini.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Pass it to me, Martini.
E: turning to Martini
N: Martini holds back.
C: MCMURPHY
D: C'mon, I'll give it back!
N: Martini passes to McMurphy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Atta boy, Martini.
N: He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands watching.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through...
E: encouraging them
N: McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them. He catches her eye. She turns away.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on, I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit or you sit...
E: V.O
S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick, Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.
C: SEFELT
D: Hit me!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
C: SEFELT
D: Boogered!
N: McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of cigarettes. As Cheswick sits down, depressed:
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, place your bets.
C: MARTINI
D: What's this?
E: holding up a cigarette
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's a dime, Martini.
N: Martini breaks a cigarette in half.
C: MARTINI
D: Bet a nickel!
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
E: to Cheswick
C: CHESWICK
D: She won't give me any more cigarettes!
C: MCMURPHY
D: That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
C: CHESWICK
D: Lend me twenty.
E: CONT'D
N: McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who bets all twenty. The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is divided.
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em.
E: checking the board
N: He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the next one face up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
C: MARTINI
D: Hit me.
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's twenty up, Martini. Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
E: hits with a picture turning to TV, he shouts across room
N: Taber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds.
C: MARTINI
D: Hit me!
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. What?
E: turning back to Taber
C: TABER
D: Koufax against Ford!
E: shouting back
C: MISS PILBOW
D: Medication time! Medication time! Medication!
E: V.O. over loudspeaker
C: MARTINI
D: Hit me!
E: simultaneously with Pilbow
N: McMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington, who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice.
S: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
N: as McMurphy enters. Nurse Pilbow is the only one there.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
E: scared out of her wits
C: MCMURPHY
D: All I'm askin' is...
N: Nurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes, holding the cross in front of her.
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic!
E: CONT'D
N: Big Nurse enters from the nurses' lounge.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Sorry, ma'am.
N: McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind him.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but doesn't take his pills.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
E: to Big Nurse
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes, Mister McMurphy?
E: politely
C: MCMURPHY
D: How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
C: BIG NURSE
D: That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
E: pleasantly
N: McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
E: confidentially
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
E: CONT'D aware of his physical proximity
N: McMurphy jerks his hand away.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...
N: McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his sleeve.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Sorry to have bothered you.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
N: McMurphy turns to walk away.
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What's the horse pill for, honey?
E: turning back, he examines the contents of the cup
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
C: NURSE PILBOW
D: Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
E: stepping back a little
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
C: BIG NURSE
D: That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
C: MCMURPHY
D: No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
N: McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth, holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice. McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him.
C: HARDING
D: Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?
C: TABER
D: Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya?
N: McMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's forehead.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
C: HARDING
D: I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
C: HARDING
D: She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
E: CONT'D
N: The men look at Big Nurse. The patients look at the nurses' station. PATIENTS' POV Big Nurse is busy at her work.
S: INT. NURSES STATION - BIG NURSE'S POV - NIGHT
N: The patients looking at her. They turn back to their card game. REVERSE ANGLE CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse as McMurphy's VOICE is HEARD over INTERCOM.

E: V.O. through intercom
N: Big Nurse looks up and studies the men gathered round the table.
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT
N: The patients are asleep except for Bromden, who stands by the window looking out. McMurphy is asleep in the bed next to his. A beat when TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder.
C: TURKLE
D: Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden...
N: Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself. Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees McMurphy looking at him. Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in the eye.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?
E: whispering sings
N: McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles through his nightstand.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Here ya go, Chief...
N: A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it. Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing. SERIES OF SHOTS SHOWING the MEN'S DORM, the empty DAY ROOM, TURKLE ASLEEP in the NURSES' STATION, EMPTY HALLWAYS, the NIGHT SUPERINTENDENT AT HER DESK, MORE HALLWAYS... ENDING ON:

E: to McMurphy
N: Washington goes off with Bromden. CAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette.

N: as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.
C: BIG NURSE

C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: I wanna report a robbery!

C: BIG NURSE
D: Oh, I had them removed.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What for?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
N: Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand.

D: Mister Washington!
E: CONT'D calling out
N: Washington comes running.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Yes, Miss Ratched?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Please see to Mister Bromden.

C: BIG NURSE
D: Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... You too, Mister McMurphy.
E: to McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?

D: You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
N: WIDER ANGLE A beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then:
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas...
N: McMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at the top of his lungs.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies.
N: BIG NURSE watching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the washroom.
S: INT. WASHROOM - DAY
N: as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE.
S: INT. MESS HALL - DAY

D: What's wrong with you guys?
E: O.S.
N: We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down his guillet. The others are barely touching their food.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... Look at this here, real orange juice! Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up...
E: holding up his orange juice slugging it down slaps his belly
N: He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter. Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
N: McMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up at the clock above the door. The time is 7:28. The second hand sweeping its way toward
C: MCMURPHY
D: Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Tha's your problem.
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
E: confidentially
C: WASHINGTON
D: Huh?
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Asshole.
E: turning away
N: McMurphy turns and walks away. Washington watches him go.
C: CHESWICK
D: I wanna know about my cigarettes!
E: V.O.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: A group meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there. Cheswick is on his feet.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Sit down, Mister Cheswick.
C: CHESWTCK
D: No, I ain't no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies! Ain't that right, Mack! Mack???
E: not sitting McMurphy doesn't respond
C: BIG NURSE
D: Sit down, Mister Cheswick!
N: Cheswick sits -- stunned. A beat; then:
C: BIG NURSE
D: You should have thought about that before you gambled all your cigarettes away. Is that clear?
E: CONT'D to Cheswick
N: Cheswick sulks in his seat.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Cheswick, is that clear!
E: CONT'D
C: CHESWICK
D: Yeah...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good... Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin?
E: opens her book
N: McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes, Mister McMurphy.
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Right!
N: McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it, studies it and begins.
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay... Item one... I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. You know, the young an' old livin' together, an' I was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. Louder so the old fellas could hear better...
N: Doctor Spivey nods with approval. Big Nurse doesn't.
T: The Acutes are bewildered.
C: MCMURPHY
D: But then I got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation...
N: Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes. Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
C: SPIVEY
D: It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
C: BIG NURSE
D: The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room?
C: SPIVEY
D: Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur. What do you think, men, is it workable?
E: he turns to the patients
C: CHESWICK
D: Right, Doc. It's workable.
N: Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
C: SPIVEY
D: Fine!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's problem... Yes, Mister McMurphy?
E: she sees McMurphy's hand up
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm not finished yet.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Go on...
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
E: looking at his list
C: BIG NURSE
D: Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah?
C: BIG NURSE
D: Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
C: MCMURPHY
D: The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
C: CHESWICK
D: I second the motion!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Atta boy, Cheswick!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Very well! All those in favor, please raise your hands.
N: Big Nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Okay, raise your hands.
E: raising his hand
N: Only Cheswick's goes up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on', what is this crap? Who wants to watch the World Series?
N: Martini and Scanlon's hands go up.
T: Several Acutes look at them.
N: Scanlon and Martini's hands go down. McMurphy can't believe his eyes.
C: BIG NURSE
D: I count only two, including you, Mister McMurphy. Certainly not enough to change ward policy.
E: CONT'D politely
N: McMurphy's hand goes down.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: No way.
C: CHESWICK
D: No way.
N: McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand pieces.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin?
E: checking her watch
N: She looks around. McMurphy is slouched in his chair. Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes, Mister Harding?
E: CONT'D
C: HARDING
D: Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
E: he stops, chews his lip, then continues
N: Harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails.
C: HARDING
D: To reflect...
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE Silence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees, the sky, ending on.
C: MARTINI
D: Hold it a minute. What's a man need to buy thum hotels?
E: V.O.
S: INT. TUB ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bromden is pressed against the wall, watching McMurphy, Martini, Scanlon and Cheswick play a game of monopoly. The others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little chagrined. Billy is most disturbed by this separation.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
C: MARTINI
D: Hold it a minute.
N: There's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow bills blowing in every direction.
C: CHESWICK
D: Let's go, for Christsakes...
C: MCMURPHY
D: It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
N: Cheswick rolls the dice.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars.
N: Cheswick starts counting out the money.
C: MARTINI
D: What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board?
C: CHESWICK
D: How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute...
E: to Martini
C: MCMURPHY
D: You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
C: SCANLON
D: Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go... Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
E: throws the dice
N: Martini picks up a house...
C: SCANLON
D: Not that one, you crazy bastard, that's my house...
E: CONT'D
N: Scanlon grabs Martini's hand and tries to get his piece back. Martini won't let go.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
C: BILLY
D: Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
E: from the next table
N: McMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
C: HARDING
D: A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
C: MCMURPHY
D: It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
C: CHESWICK
D: Right!
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Oh, yeah?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah!
C: SEFELT
D: Big man!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
C: SEFELT
D: On what?
C: MCMURPHY
D: That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
C: HARDING
D: And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
N: McMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and Scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again. Bromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants listening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but doesn't know how.
C: SEFELT
D: Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him.
N: Sefelt and Frederickson smile at each other. Bromden slides along the wall toward the door.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
C: SEFELT
D: Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
E: CONT'D
N: Fredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You think it's funny, huh?
C: TABER
D: Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
N: Bromden reaches the door and looks out. No one is there.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
C: TABER
D: Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
E: CONT'D
N: Bromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
E: rising and turning on the others, who back off
C: TABER
D: Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: All right!
N: He looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses to it and smacks it with his hand.
C: MCMURPHY
D: With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
C: HARDING
D: You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
C: MCMURPHY
D: You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
C: HARDING
D: With your own two hands?
E: CONT'D
C: MCMURPHY
D: You heard me the first time!
C: TABER
D: I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
C: MCMURPHY
D: You're on!
C: BILLY
D: M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
C: SEFELT
D: I'll bet a dollar.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Me, too...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Right!
C: MARTINI
D: A nickel.
C: SCANLON
D: A dime.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Okay. Who else?
C: HARDING
D: Twenty-five dollars.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Okay, Harding, you're on.
E: knows he's taking a bad bet
C: HARDING
D: Okay, sucker.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
N: The Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine. He shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each side, and strains. Bromden watches, in awe of McMurphy. McMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for a better position.
C: HARDING
D: Giving up?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Just warmin' up.
N: He grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall. There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath. He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.
C: MCMURPHY
D: But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much. Didn't I?
N: McMurphy exits.
T: REACTION SHOT OF ACUTES
N: SHOT OF BROMDEN looking at the machine. A long beat.
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT
N: The patients are getting ready for bed when Billy approaches McMurpby, who is in bed.
C: BILLY
D: M-M-Mack...
N: McMurphy turns away from Billy, who crosses to the other side of the bed.
C: BILLY
D: M-M-Mack, I-I-I'm sorry!
E: CONT'D
C: HARDING
D: Leave him alone, he's pouting.
C: BILLY
D: Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's okay, kid...
C: BILLY
D: Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
C: MCMURPHY
D: No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
C: BILLY
D: O-o-o-oh...
C: MCMURPHY
D: What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
C: BILLY
D: 'K-k-kay, Mack!
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Washington, Warren and Miller are at the end of the hallway, listening to a small RADIO. We can HEAR the SPORTS ANNOUNCER giving the line-up for the opening game of the World Series.
C: WASHINGTON'S POV
D: Way down the hall, the Group Meeting is SEEN in progress.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: A Group Meeting is in progress and Big Nurse is honed in on Billy.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Try, Billy, try...
N: Billy tries, but can't talk. The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting. McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: Y-y-y-yes...
C: BIG NURSE
D: Tell us about it...
C: BILLY
D: I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
N: Billy laughs at himself.
C: BIG NURSE
D: What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
C: BILLY
D: I was in luh-love with her.
E: rubbing scars on his wrist
C: BIG NURSE
D: Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
N: No response from Billy.
C: BIG NURSE
D: That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy.
E: CONT'D no response
C: MCMURPHY
D: Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
C: MCMURPHY
D: What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
C: CHESWICK
D: Yeah, let's vote on it!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Will one more vote satisfy you?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
C: BIG NURSE
D: A vote is before the group.
E: to the patients
C: MCMURPHY
D: Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
N: The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's. Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber. Harding doesn't vote. Big Nurse starts counting the hands. McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands.
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's it! We made it!
C: BIG NURSE
D: I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
C: MCMURPHY
D: So do I!
C: BIG NURSE
D: But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
E: the light dawning
C: BIG NURSE
D: I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
C: BILLY
D: B-But, M-M-Miss R-Ratched, y-you n never c-c-counted th-their votes before!
N: A beat.
C: BIG NURSE
D: You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
E: losing ground
C: BILLY
D: I-I-I...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, screw that noise!
N: McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the television set.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Sit down, Mister McMurphy!
N: McMurphy turns the TV on, flips the channel, then sits and waits for a picture.
C: BIG NURSE
D: I want you to turn the television off and return to your place!
E: CONT'D
N: A picture swirls onto the TV screen. The ballgame is in progress (documentary footage to be used). Martini rushes over and joins McMurphy. Scanlon follows hot on his heels as --
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is a can of beer and a red-hot.
N: Cheswick gets up and starts across when --
C: BIG NURSE
D: Sit down, Mister Cheswick.
N: Cheswick stops and stands there, helpless to move.
C: CHESWICK
D: Mack...
N: McMurphy is deep into the game. INSERT - TV SCREEN On the screen a great play is taking place, and at the breathtaking moment the TV picture swirls into a little eye of light -- then nothing. BACK TO SCENE The Acutes are left with their mouths hanging open.
C: BIG NURSE
D: I want you men to return to your proper places. The group meeting is not over!
E: V.O. over loudspeaker
N: McMurphy continues looking at the blank TV screen as the Acutes look from McMurphy to Big Nurse, not knowing what to do next when --
C: MCMURPHY
D: A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding first, heading for second. Here comes the throw. He's sliding... and... he's safe! He's safe! Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game! Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out!
E: jumping up and shouting at the blank TV screen McMurphy whistles and claps his hands
N: The Acutes are stunned at McMurphy's outburst.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
E: V.O. over loudspeaker
C: MCMURPHY
D: He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
N: Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber get up and cross toward the TV. Harding is the only one who doesn't join them.
C: BIG NURSE
D: You men remain seated!
E: V.O. over loudspeaker
C: MCMURPHY
D: He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!

E: jumping up and down
C: SCANLON
D: Me, too! Me, too!

D: Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
E: on his feet, shouting
N: The other Acutes pick up on McMurphy and start shouting at the blank TV screen.
T: ACUTES
N: Ya-hoo! It's a hit! A triple! It's a home run! A double! He's out! Whadaya blind? He's safe by a mile! (AD LIB)
C: BIG NURSE
D: You boys, stop this and go to your assignments! Mister McMurphy, I want you to set an example...
E: V.O. over loudspeaker
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded as Koufax steps up to the mound... Checks the runners... goes into his wind-up... Here comes the three-two pitch... And it's a fly ball into deep center. Mantle is going back. He's going back! Back! His back is up against the wall... and... he catches it! He catches it!
N: The Acutes are shouting, cheering, stomping and dancing in each other's arms.
C: BIG NURSE'S VOICE
D: You men stop this! Mister Washington! Miller! Warren!
E: over loudspeaker
N: Big Nurse's last words overload the intercom and the system peaks out. Big Nurse's mouth continues to work in frantic circles as Washington, Miller and Warren rush to quell the uproar.
S: INT. SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, looking over McMurphy's papers. McMurphy sits facing him.
C: SPIVEY
D: How are you feeling?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
C: SPIVEY
D: Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
C: SPIVEY
D: Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
C: SPIVEY
D: Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
N: This is the kiss of death to McMurphy.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
C: SPIVEY
D: I'm afraid not.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
C: SPIVEY
D: No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
C: SPIVEY
D: I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
C: MCMURPHY
D: When?
C: SPIVEY
D: We'll let you know.
N: REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.

D: Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I don't want you to move from this spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the ball! Raise your hands, like this...
E: with great physical and vocal emphasis throughout entire scene
N: McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows suit.
C: MCMURPHY
D: That's good! That's a good boy, Chief! Now jump and put it in!
N: McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.
C: HARDING
D: He can't hear you!
C: MCMURPHY
D: I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
C: HARDING
D: So why are you talking to him?
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
C: HARDING
D: It doesn't help him.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Well, it doesn't hurt him either! Does it, Chief! See, it doesn't hurt him. Jump! An' put it in!
E: turning to Bromden no response to Bromden
N: McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move.
C: HARDING

N: as McMurphy crosses down the hallway and stops at the mess hall door. He tries the handle. The door is locked. McMurphy looks up at the open transom, ponders it, then jumps up and grabs the door lintel. He tries to lift himself up, but can't make it when suddenly he is lifted up to the level of the transom by Bromden. McMurphy worms his way through the transom and disappears down the other side. CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden who waits. A long beat. There is a strange HUMMING SOUND HEARD O.S. Another beat, then the door opens. McMurphy smiles at Bromden.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Wait here, Chief. Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's crazy.

C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on, you guys, let's stick together.
E: calling back
N: The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection and turn the corner. No sign of Martini or Scanlon. Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming their way.
C: TABER
D: Somebody's coming!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Shhh! This way!
E: he listens then
N: McMurphy hustles the men round the corner as two aides pushing a gurney come wheeling by.
C: BILLY
D: I-I-I th-th-think we sh-sh-should go back!
C: SEFELT
D: Yeah, my feet are gettin' cold.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Mine, too!

D: We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
T: ACUTES
N: (simultaneously) 'Kay, Mack! The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?" Down one tunnel and up another -- till they turn a corner and see an open door. They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the outside world.
C: MCMURPHY
D: They must be up there!
C: CHESWICK
D: Yeah!
C: BILLY

C: TABER
D: Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
N: McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..." McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for McMurphy to take them back.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Get on assholes!

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN
N: The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads: DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea. The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.
C: MCMURPHY
D: This is it!
E: as he steps out of the bus
N: as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door, lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the door and enters. A beat, then the lights go on inside the building. SHOT OF BUS The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.
S: INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN
N: as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then crosses to the heater and turns it on. Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd the room. There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts, hostess cupcakes, etc. McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys are there. INSERT - KEYBOARD with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann. Noel. Annabella. The Capri.
S: INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN
N: McMurphy studying the board as the Acutes stick their heads in the door. They're all miserable and cold.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on in an' warm up. You can put some of that gear on to keep warm. An' there's beer an' Coke in the cooler an' some food over here...
N: They hesitate.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come on, don't be shy now, you're among friends.
N: The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear. Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the room.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Why don't one of you boys help ol' Chief there get warmed up?
N: Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window and looks out. McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.
C: CHESWICK
D: When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
E: looking out the window
N: The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What? What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."
C: MARTINI
D: Oh, look at the pretty boat.
T: ACUTES' POV
N: Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler, beautifully framed in the bay window.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, did you ever see a boat like that? Why, I'll bet you could go all the way to Hawaii in that boat! Tahiti... the Philippines... Tibet...
E: V.O.
N: CAMERA HOLDS on FULL SHOT of the boat. BACK TO SCENE A long beat, then we SEE the Acutes, wearing wet weather gear, complete with boots and squall hats, each man carrying soda pop, food, fishing equipment, etc., being led onto the boat by McMurphy who carries a case of beer.
S: EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAWN
N: as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and the boat pulls away from the dock, leaving a boiling foam of water.
S: INT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - DAWN
N: The entire crew is jammed into the bridge, McMurphy behind the wheel. McMURPHY'S POV as the dock and other fishing boats slip by.
S: EXT. HARBOR JETTY - DAWN
N: as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open sea.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY
N: The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby, fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in. Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.
C: BILLY
D: H-H-Help!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
N: Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and starts to take the pole from him.
C: SCANLON
D: My turn.
C: MARTINI
D: No.
E: hanging onto the pole
N: They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up, when he gets a strike and his line spins out. Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go down and the line snaps.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Up, I told you! Keep that tip up... up! You had you one big silver there.
N: Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood. The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish and wrestles it down. Bromden lands a fish when --
C: SEFELT
D: Oh, my God! I see something!
E: O.S.
N: Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water. REVERSE SHOT Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out of the depths, becoming solid, alive.
C: SCANLON
D: Jesus God...
C: MARTINI
D: What is it?
C: FREDRICKSON
D: We'll never get that on the boat.
N: The fish is now clearly SEEN.

E: calling
N: McMurphy pulls himself up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What is it, kid?
C: BILLY
D: C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
N: McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.
C: MCMURPHY
D: He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
C: BILLY
D: I-I-I'll get them.
C: MARTINI
D: Me, too.
C: SCANLON
D: Me, too.
N: McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Steady does it, Sefelt!
N: SEFELT'S POV The massive fish is closer to the surface.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: BACK TO SCENE All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the water. McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter, handshakes and back-slapping going on when --
C: VOICE
D: All right! Stand to! Stand to!
E: over bull horn
N: The men look up.
T: REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV
N: Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides dressed in white.
S: INT. HALLWAY - STATE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON
N: as the Acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by Washington, Warren and Doctor Spivey. It's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches for all to see. McMurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is SEEN welding a lock on the dumbwaiter.
S: INT. DAY ROOM
N: as Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station.
C: SPIVEY
D: Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe and sound!
E: to Big Nurse
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy yourselves?
N: A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Show her the one you caught, Jim.
E: to Sefelt
N: Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.
C: BIG NURSE
D: My, my...
N: No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in himself" AD LIB.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
C: MCMURPHY
D: Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
E: loudly
C: BIG NURSE
D: No, it was irresponsible!
N: Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.
C: BIG NURSE
D: That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat are you going to do with it?
E: CONT'D respectfully
C: MARTINI
D: Gimme a cigarette!
E: crossing to McMurphy
C: SEFELT
D: I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
C: MCMURPHY
D: I don't have any.
E: reaches in his pocket; he has none
N: AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."
C: BIG NURSE
D: That's an excellent idea. Now, why don't you boys place your fish on the gurney and we'll see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner.
E: CONT'D
N: The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I don't have any."
C: BIG NURSE
D: Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington to the showers, supper is in half an hour.
E: CONT'D
N: The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and crosses to him.
C: MARTINI
D: Gimme a cigarette!
E: to Harding
C: HARDING
D: No!
C: MARTINI
D: Why not?
C: HARDING
D: I'm not running a charity ward...
N: Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes off with Harding chasing him. Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can. Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette over Harding's head to Scanlon. Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid. Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in the room is getting wired. Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to the floor.
C: MARTINI
D: All gone! All gone! Don't hit! Don't hit!
E: holding his hands up; empty
N: Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him. Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren and Miller move in and start separating the men. McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately crosses toward the Nurses' Station.
S: INT. NURSES' STATION - MISS PILBOW'S POV - DAY
N: as McMurphy reaches the Nurses' Station and puts his hand through the plate glass window, his fist stopping inches from Miss Pilbow's startled face. Miss Pilbow's scream is added to the SOUND OF THE SHATTERED WINDOW.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: McMurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes.
C: MCMURPHY
D: I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I am. That window glass was so clean I didn't even see it...
N: McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the carton of cigarettes as he goes.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You guys want cigarettes! Here's the goddamn cigarettes!
N: McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm and tries to wheel him away. McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in Washington's face. Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out, chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing him against the wall. McMurphy moves in for the kill.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Warren! Miller!
N: The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching. McMurphy tags Washington, then is grabbed from behind by Warren, who pulls him back. Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when Bromden grabs Washington, from behind, in a bear hug. Miller jumps on Bromden's back. Bromden, still holding Washington, backs up into the wall, squashing Miller, who screams out.
S: EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a double set of heavy security doors. The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and Bromden step through, followed by the aides.
S: INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: As the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead Bromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle them.
C: AIDE
D: Wait over there...
E: pointing to a bench
N: The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is a man sitting next to them. McMURPHY'S POV The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other. Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much sedation). Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily, shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat, then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat, talking softly to the man. Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to sleep it off. Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to McMurpby.
C: AIDE
D: Come on, Joey... this isn't going to hurt you... good for you... make you feel better...
E: CONT'D approaching him very gently
N: The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping. The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall to the EST room. ANOTHER ANGLE As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one. McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.
C: BROMDEN
D: Thank you.
N: McMurphy looks up. A long beat.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Say it again.
C: BROMDEN
D: Thank you.
N: Another beat.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Say... God Bless America!
C: BROMDEN
D: God Bless America.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
E: slapping his thigh

D: Yeah...
C: MCMURPHY

C: BROMDEN
D: Ca-na-da...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand?
N: Bromden nods.

D: Yeah...
N: McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in. Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.
S: INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty gurney. A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of him.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Hi...
E: as he enters
N: McMurphy looks around at the six aides.
C: MCMURPHY
D: You boys can take a cigarette break now...
N: The Nurse smiles at him.
C: DOCTOR
D: That's all right, Mister McMurphy, just climb on the bed and lie down...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Whatever you say, Doc...
N: McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down. The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve.
C: DOCTOR
D: This won't hurt you at all...
E: to McMurphy
C: MCMURPHY
D: Uh, uh...
N: The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.
C: MCMURPHY
D: What's that for?
C: NURSE
D: Conductant.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Surely, goodness and mercy will follow this, eh, honey?
E: smiling up at her
C: DOCTOR
D: Please, put this in your mouth...
E: holding a mouthpiece
N: McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's temples. The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently place their hands, in a very professional manner, on McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor turns to his controls. SHOT OF McMURPHY as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning, McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the gurney, until the last spasm subsides.

N: TO:
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

E: to Sefelt
C: SEFELT
D: It's the Dilantin that makes my gums soft!
C: BIG NURSE
D: Now, Jim, you must be honest with yourself.
N: At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass into the hallway. Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room. The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his hand.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Yes, Mister Fredrickson?
E: CONT'D
C: FREDRICKSON
D: I wanna know why the dorm has to be locked in the daytime and on weekends?

D: If the dorms were left open, you would just return to bed after breakfast...
E: CONT'D
C: FREDRICKSON
D: So what? Is it a mortal sin? I mean, normal people get to sleep late on weekends...
C: BIG NURSE
D: With few exceptions, time spent in the company of others is therapeutic, while every minute spent brooding alone only increases separation.
C: CHESWICK
D: Mack!
E: jumping up as he sees McMurphy
N: Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden. Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh. McMURPHY Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you creeps, you goons... He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.
C: MCMURPHY
D: I got ten thousand watts and hot to trot. First woman takes me on is gonna light up like a pinball machine an' pay off in silver dollars...
N: McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower, his footwork slightly out of sync.
C: BILLY
D: H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...

C: BIG NURSE
D: I hope everything is settled.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
N: Spivey greets McMurphy.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Good. Why don't you join us?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Why, thank you, ma'am... Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else! Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game? I figured as much...

N: No response from McMurphy.
C: HARDING
D: What's your plan, Mack?
C: MCMURPHY
D: Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
E: coming out of it
N: McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins Bromden who is looking out the window. REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each other with quizzical looks.

C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Thank you, boys.
E: wrapping it up
N: The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits in the front row. It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male and female patients, staff members and visitors. Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
C: BIG NURSE

Under the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the ball into the basket. The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 2 Bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the court and takes up his position under the Aides' basket, while McMurphy and his teammates have been putting tremendous pressure on the Aides, not allowing them to pass the ball in. As soon as McMurphy sees that Bromden is firmly set, hands held up, under the Aides' basket, McMurphy turns and runs down court, followed by the other Acutes, where they take up their defensive position. Washington and the Aides easily bring the ball down court, work themselves into position, and take a shot at the basket, which Bromden swats aside.

The ball rolls to Martini, who scoops it up and throwing it wildly away, the ball ricochets off the backboard and goes in for two points. The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6 Bromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast break past him, but miss their shot. McMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns and slams the ball in for another basket. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 8 The crowd goes bananas and Bromden turns and starts striding down the court when he sees McMurphy at the far end of the court yelling at him.

D: That's all I'm going to show you.
N: McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE as the two of them cross out of the day room toward the hallway, Turkle suddenly turns and hurries back to McMurphy, takes the bottle of booze and hurries off clucking to himself. BACK TO McMURPHY and CANDY.
C: MCMURPHY
D: 'Kay, lets get under way.
N: McMurphy crosses to package of booze, selects another bottle, unscrews the top and takes a long pull, then hands the bottle to Bromden.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Down the ol' hatch, Chief.
N: Bromden takes a long pull on the bottle, gags and passes the bottle to McMurphy who crosses to the nurses' station and peeks around the corner. McMURPHY as he peeks around the corner. McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE far down the hallway, as Turkle shows Rose one room, then another, and then the seclusion room, into which Turkle playfully lures Rose, who playfully resists, but finally enters. A beat passes and they don't come out. BACK TO McMURPHY Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the open side-door window, opens the door and enters.

S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses' station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey, McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups. Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall.

C: TURKLE
D: Shit, it's the soo-per-visor come to fire my black ass.
N: A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock at the end of the hallway. Without losing a beat, Turkle reverses his movement and starts pushing everybody back into the nurses' station.

E: CONT'D pushing
N: As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room.

N: as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses' lounge and opens the door.
C: TURKLE
D: Alla ya goons, get in here!

C: NIGHT SUPERVISOR
D: I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
C: TURKLE
D: Yes, ma'am...

D: Be right back, honey...
E: CONT'D
N: Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station, and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine.
S: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
N: as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and steps into the room.
S: INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: as Turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the plundering. The filing cabinet is open. So is the medicine cabinet. Rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough syrup and orange juice are flowing. The patients start piling out of the room, carrying their plunder. Fredrickson and Sefelt are SEEN sitting on the floor, in front of the open refrigerator, looking through their dossiers.
C: FREDRICKSON
D: Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
C: SEFELT
D: Lemme see...

D: Jesus, they're terrible grades, Fred...
E: CONT'D
N: Turkle stoically takes in the shattered remains of his job, unscrews the top to his bottle of whiskey, and takes the biggest swig of his life as, O.S., Rose is HEARD SCREAMING.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: as Rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down the hall, Ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see Rose enter the room. She runs behind McMurphy, pressing her body to his, as he gently takes hold of Ellis' outstretched hands.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Don't scream, honey...
E: to Rose
N: He gently guides Ellis to the wall, with Rose still clinging to his back.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Ellis ain't gonna hurt you... Ellis is nice... Nice Ellis... see the nice lady...
N: He pins Ellis to the wall.
C: MCMURPHY
D: There, see, nice lady touch Ellis...

N: Another SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy, Candy, Harding, Cheswick, Taber, Sefelt and Fredrickson watch Rose, on a table, doing a solo bump-and grind dance, while Martini and Scanlon race around the room in wheelchairs. Billy sits, watching Candy and McMurphy, who sit across the room. Candy is tired and bored. McMurphy is drunk and starting to fade.
C: CANDY
D: It's time to hit the road, Mack...
C: MCMURPHY
D: Don't worry 'bout the road! We'll hit the road! It'll be there when we're ready! Ain't that right, fellas?

E: softly
N: Billy doesn't move.
C: MCMURPHY
D: Go on, son, now's your chance...
N: Billy slowly crosses toward Candy, stopping halfway to look back at McMurphy, who gives him an affirmative gesture. He crosses to Candy, who just looks at him.
C: BILLY
D: C-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu marry me!
C: CANDY
D: Ah, Billy...
N: Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him. McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle, takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden. Bromden sits by the window waiting.

S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: as the MUSIC ENDS. A long silence, then another NUMBER begins as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks around. McMURPHY'S POV Bromden sits by the window waiting. Cheswick is asleep on the table. Martini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling their cups from through the enema tube. Harding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette. Sefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while Fredrickson dances around him. Candy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying to the MUSIC. McMURPHY struggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the nurses' station.
S: INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: as McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep. McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves.

S: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
N: MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy crashes heavily into his chair. He can hardly keep his eyes open as he looks around. Harding sits nearby. Taber is lying on a couch, his head in Rose's lap. Cheswick is asleep on the table. Ellis stands nailed to the wall. Bromden sits by the window -- waiting. CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden.

S: INT. DAY ROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: as Washington jostles McMurphy awake.
C: WASHINGTON
D: Come on, get over there!
N: McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are lined up. It is morning and the day room is a mess: A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles. Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked into sticky masses. Rose sits by herself on the couch. Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse waits.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Thank you, Mister Washington! Mister McMurphy, do you know where Billy is?
N: McMurphy shrugs "no."
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Harding, have you seen Billy?
E: CONT'D
N: Harding shrugs "no."
C: BIG NURSE
D: Mister Sefelt...
E: CONT'D
N: Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start laughing. Big Nurse turns to see Turkle, without his shirt on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind him. Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as Big Nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.
S: INT. SECLUSION ROOM - EARLY MORNING

E: to Washington
C: WASHINGTON
D: Yes, Miss Ratched...
N: Washington nods to Warren and the two of them scoop Billy off the floor and carry him screaming to Doctor Spivey's office as Big Nurse crosses into the nurses' station and picks up the phone as Candy eases her way into the day room and joins McMurphy. A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't move. McMurphy pulls the keys out of his pocket.

C: WASHINGTON
D: 'Kay, let's have the keys an' nobody get hurt!
E: stopping just short
N: Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her). Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. McMurphy is glued to the spot.
C: CANDY

E: calling from outside
N: McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the hallway.
S: INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING
N: CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients, who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients. The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is stricken by what he sees. McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up, hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of Spivey's family, lies nearby.

S: INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
N: as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse. Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes as he passes out.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to Martini, Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson. Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of paper. Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, "Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms outstretched.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Bromden is squatting, leaning against the wall near the security gate to the visitors' room, when a KEY HITS THE LOCK. He looks up expectantly. This time it is McMurphy. Or what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room by an ATTENDANT. McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the same act he did when he came back from Electro-Shock Therapy. Bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day room.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: as Bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits facing the hallway, bursting with expectation. A long beat, then the Attendant appears with McMurphy and taps at the side door to the nurses' station. The Acutes break off their card game and look at McMurphy; their faces hang open at his appearance. Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out into the day room. To the Attendant as she takes McMurphy by the arm:
C: BIG NURSE
D: Thank you...
C: ATTENDANT
D: Yes, ma'am...
N: The Attendant exits.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Now, let's find you a place to sit, shall we, Mister McMurphy?
E: to McMurphy
N: Big Nurse gently guides McMurphy to a seat on the Chronics' side of the room. Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy to go into his act. The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's condition as they exchange looks with each other.

D: Lobotomy...
E: whispering
C: HARDING
D: Yeah...
C: SCANLON
D: Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla shit...
N: The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles and deals the cards out. Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.
C: BIG NURSE
D: Here now, you sit here... That's it...
E: sitting McMurphy down
N: Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the nurses' station. McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side. Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine. McMurphy just sits there. Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for McMurphy to follow suit. McMurphy just sits there slobbering. Bromden slaps his thigh again. No response from McMurphy. The MUSIC PLAYS ON.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK
N: as Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat, then he turns into the room and looks around. BROMDEN'S POV The patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast asleep in the nurses' station. Bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed, where he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A long beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.
C: BROMDEN
D: When I first came here I was so scared of being lost I had to holler so they could track me... I figured anything was better than being lost...
E: whispering in McMurphy's ear
N: On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAYBREAK
N: The night attendant continues to sleep as Bromden passes the nurses' station, heading for the tub room.
S: INT. TUB ROOM - DAWN
N: as Bromden crosses to the heavy machine which McMurphy had once tried to lift, sizes it up, then bends over and takes hold and heaves. The GRINDING WEIGHT is HEARD as Bromden exerts all his strength, slowly lifts the machine off the floor, balances it above his shoulders, then crosses out of the tub room.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN
N: as Bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping night attendant in the nurses' station. Bromden lines himself up with the window across the room, then starts toward it, picking up speed as he goes. Then, at the last moment, he stops and, with an enormous effort, he hurls the machine through the security screen and the window. A LOUD CRASH. In the nurses' station, the night attendant starts awake and looks around. Too late as Bromden vaults through the window. CAMERA HOLDS on window as Bromden runs across the grounds and disappears into the pine trees.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN
N: as the night attendant comes out of the nurses' station and looks confusedly around. Then he spots the shattered window.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - SUNRISE
N: Rolling hills, forests and distant mountains, bathed in sunlight, as Bromden runs across a far-off meadow. CREDITS OVER. THE END
