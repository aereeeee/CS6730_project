N: (READING) From 1964 to 1966 I successfully impersonated an airline pilot for Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two million miles for free. During that time I was also the Chief Resident Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital, the Assistant Attorney General for the state of Louisiana, and a Professor of American History at a prestigious University in France. By the time I was caught and sentenced to prison, I had cashed over six million dollars in fraudulent checks in 26 foreign countries and all fifty states, and I did it all before my 18th birthday. To this day, I am the only teenager ever to have been placed on the FBI' s most wanted list. My name is a Abagna l e Jr. Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk behind a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly the same time. BUD COLLY (cont'd ) Okay, panel, you have ork cut out for you. Kitty Carl , you have the first question.
