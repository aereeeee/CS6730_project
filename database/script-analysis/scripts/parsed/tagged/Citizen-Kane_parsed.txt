S: EXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)
N: Window, very small in the distance, illuminated. All around this is an almost totally black screen. Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work. Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky. Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL TELLING SOMETHING OF: The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE. Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see. Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made. Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes. The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE) Past which we move. The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
N: WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE) Of the Hagenbeck type. All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large. (Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)
T: DISSOLVE:
N: THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE) In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk. He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE) The idiot pile of sleepy dragons. Reflected in the muddy water - the lighted window. THE LAGOON (MINIATURE) The boat landing sags. An old newspaper floats on the surface of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer." As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before. THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE) It is empty. A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE) In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle. As we move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
N: A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE) Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds. We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle. The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape. As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds. The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing. Moss, moss, moss. Ankor Wat, the night the last King died.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: THE WINDOW (MINIATURE) Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen. Suddenly, the light within goes out. This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence. In the glass panes of the window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.

S: INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.
N: An incredible one. Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too picturesque farmhouse and a snow man. The jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -
C: KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE
D: Rosebud...
N: The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores all over the world. A hand - Kane's hand, which has been holding the ball, relaxes. The ball falls out of his hand and bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera following. The ball falls off the last step onto the marble floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first rays of the morning sun. This ray cuts an angular pattern across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of light as the blinds are pulled across the window. The foot of Kane's bed. The camera very close. Outlined against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head. The camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the face after the sheet has covered it.

S: INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM
N: On the screen as the camera moves in are the words: "MAIN TITLE" Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.) The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second title appears: "CREDITS" NOTE: Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events or personalities. These are distinguished from ordinary newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed editorial or storyline. Some of the more obvious characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject. As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator is used as well as explanatory titles.

C: NEWS DIGEST NARRATOR
D: Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Kahn decreed his stately pleasure dome - "Where twice five miles of fertile ground, with walls and towers were girdled 'round."
E: with quotes in his voice
N: (DROPPING THE QUOTES) Today, almost as legendary is Florida's XANADU - world's largest private pleasure ground. Here, on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned, successfully built for its landlord. Here in a private valley, as in the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many an incense-bearing tree." Verily, "a miracle of rare device." U.S.A. CHARLES FOSTER KANE Opening shot of great desolate expanse of Florida coastline (1940 - DAY)
T: DISSOLVE:
N: Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the Prologue (1940).
C: NARRATOR
D: Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will be held 1940's biggest, strangest funeral; here this week is laid to rest a potent figure of our Century - America's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane. In journalism's history, other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane's, more justly revered. Among publishers, second only to James Gordon Bennet the First: his dashing, expatriate son; England's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; Chicago's Patterson and McCormick;
E: dropping the quotes
N: TITLE: TO FORTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. NEWS BUYERS, MORE NEWSWORTHY THAN THE NAMES IN HIS OWN HEADLINES, WAS KANE HIMSELF, GREATEST NEWSPAPER TYCOON OF THIS OR ANY OTHER GENERATION. Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane. Pull back to show that it is a picture on the front page of the "Enquirer," surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead and headlines. (1940)
T: DISSOLVE:
N: A great number of headlines, set in different types and different styles, obviously from different papers, all announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign languages). An important item in connection with the headlines is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately conflicting opinions about Kane. Thus, they contain variously the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc. TITLE: 1895 TO 1940 - ALL OF THESE YEARS HE COVERED, MANY OF THESE YEARS HE WAS. Newsreel shots of San Francisco during and after the fire, followed by shots of special trains with large streamers: "Kane Relief Organization." Over these shots superimpose the date - Artist's painting of Foch's railroad car and peace negotiators, if actual newsreel shot unavailable. Over this shot sumperimpose the date - 1918.
C: NARRATOR
D: Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer; America's emperor of the news syndicate, another editorialist and landlord, the still mighty and once mightier Hearst. Great names all of them - but none of them so loved, hated, feared, so often spoken - as Charles Foster Kane. The San Francisco earthquake. First with the news were the Kane papers. First with Relief of the Sufferers, First with the news of their Relief of the Sufferers. Kane papers scoop the world on the Armistice - publish, eight hours before competitors, complete details of the Armistice teams granted the Germans by Marshall Foch from his railroad car in the Forest of Compeigne. For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand. No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce - often support, then denounce. Its humble beginnings, a dying dailey -
N: Shots with the date - 1898 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1910 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1922 (to be supplied) Headlines, cartoons, contemporary newreels or stills of the following: 1. WOMAN SUFFRAGE The celebrated newsreel shot of about 1914. 2. PROHIBITION Breaking up of a speakeasy and such. 3. T.V.A. 4. LABOR RIOTS Brief clips of old newreel shots of William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Stalin, Walter P. Thatcher, Al Smith, McKinley, Landon, Franklin D. Roosevelt and such. Also, recent newsreels of the elderly Kane with such Nazis as Hitler and Goering; and England's Chamberlain and Churchill. Shot of a ramshackle building with old-fashioned presses showing through plate glass windows and the name "Enquirer" in old- fashioned gold letters. (1892)

C: NARRATOR
D: Kane's empire, in its glory, held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers, thirteen magazines, a radio network. An empire upon an empire. The first of grocery stores, paper mills, apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed, in an unending stream, the wealth of the earth's third richest gold mine... Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune... How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft: The Colorado Lode. The magnificent Enquirer Building of today.
N: 1891-1911 - a map of the USA, covering the entire screen, which in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from city to city. Starting from New York, minature newboys speed madly to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc., screaming "Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry." Shot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, trains moving in and out, etc. A large sign reads "Colorado Lode Mining Co." (1940) Sign reading; "Little Salem, CO - 25 MILES."
T: DISSOLVE:
N: An old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago (identified by copper-plate caption beneath the still). (1870) Shot of early tintype stills of Thomas Foster Kane and his wife, Mary, on their wedding day. A similar picture of Mary Kane some four or five years later with her little boy, Charles Foster Kane.
C: NARRATOR
D: Fifty-seven years later, before a Congressional Investigation, Walter P. Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street, for years chief target of Kane papers' attack on "trusts," recalls a journey he made as a youth...
N: Shot of Capitol, in Washington D.C. Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of existing J.P. Morgan newsreel). This runs silent under narration. Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand. He is flanked by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners. He is being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen. At this moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment. Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now
T: fades in.
C: THATCHER
D: ... because of that trivial incident...
C: INVESTIGATOR
D: It is a fact, however, is it not, that in 1870, you did go to Colorado?
C: THATCHER
D: I did.
C: INVESTIGATOR
D: In connection with the Kane affairs?
C: THATCHER
D: Yes. My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs. Kane for the fortune, which she had recently acquired. It was her wish that I should take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
C: NARRATOR
D: That same month in Union Square -
C: INVESTIGATOR
D: Is it not a fact that on that occasion, the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
N: Loud laughter and confusion.
C: THATCHER
D: Mr. Chairman, I will read to this committee a prepared statement I have brought with me - and I will then refuse to answer any further questions. Mr. Johnson, please!
N: A young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase.
C: THATCHER
D: "With full awareness of the meaning of my words and the responsibility of what I am about to say, it is my considered belief that Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner in which he has persistently attacked the American traditions of private property, initiative and opportunity for advancement, is - in fact - nothing more or less than a Communist."

N: Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying banners urging the boycott of Kane papers. A speaker is on the platform above the crowd.
C: SPEAKER
D: - till the words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every working man in this land. He is today what he has always been and always will be - A FASCIST!
E: fading in on soundtrack
C: NARRATOR
D: And yet another opinion - Kane's own.
N: Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of the magnificent Enquirer building. On platform, in full ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane. He orates silently. TITLE: "I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN." CHARLES FOSTER KANE. Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame. Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his second wife in a nightclub. He looks lonely and unhappy in the midst of the gaiety.
C: NARRATOR
D: Twice married, twice divorced - first to a president's niece, Emily Norton - today, by her second marriage, chatelaine of the oldest of England's stately homes. Sixteen years after that - two weeks after his divorce from Emily Norton - Kane married Susan Alexander, singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey.
N: TITLE: FEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC. Period still of Emily Norton (1900).
T: DISSOLVE:
N: Reconstructed silent newsreel. Kane, Susan, and Bernstein emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press photographers, reporters, etc. Kane looks startled, recoils for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit.
C: NARRATOR
D: For wife two, one-time opera singing Susan Alexander, Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House. Cost: three million dollars. Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him, the still unfinished Xanadu. Cost: no man can say.
N: Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" of the Chicago Municipal Opera House.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920) Then shots of its preparation. (1917) Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by with tremendous noise. Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels. Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters. In quick succession, shots follow each other, some reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.
C: NARRATOR
D: One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble, are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain. Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle - two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah. Contents of Kane's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace, shipped to Florida from every corner of the earth, from other Kane houses, warehouses, where they mouldered for years. Enough for ten museums - the loot of the world.
N: More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a large mountain - at different periods in its development - rising out of the sands. Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, shipped, etc. in various ways. Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster Kane, Xanadu, Florida. A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace. A group of persons in clothes of the period of 1917. In their midst, clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan.
C: NARRATOR
D: Kane urged his country's entry into one war, opposed participation in another. Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin. Thus, Kane's papers might never have survived - had not the President.
N: TITLE: FROM XANADU, FOR THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, ALL KANE ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, MANY OF THE NATIONS DESTINIES SHAPED. Shots of various authentically worded headlines of American papers since 1895. Spanish-American War shots. (1898) A graveyard in France of the World War and hundreds of crosses. Old newsreels of a political campaign. Insert of a particularly virulent headline and/or cartoon. HEADLINE: "PRESIDENT SHOT"
C: NARRATOR
D: Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was, in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country. Few U.S. news publishers have been. Few, like one-time Congressman Hearst, have ever run for any office - most know better - conclude with other political observers that one man's press has power enough for himself. But Kane papers were once strong indeed, and once the prize seemed almost his. In 1910, as Independent Candidate for governor, the best elements of the state behind him - the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career -
N: NIGHT SHOT OF CROWD BURNING CHARLES FOSTER KANE IN EFFIGY. THE DUMMY BEARS A GROTESQUE, COMIC RESEMBLANCE TO KANE. IT IS TOSSED INTO THE FLAMES, WHICH BURN UP - AND THEN DOWN... (1910)

N: TITLE: IN POLITICS - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE Newsreel shots of great crowds streaming into a building - Madison Square Garden - then shots inside the vast auditorium, at one end of which is a huge picture of Kane. (1910) Shot of box containing the first Mrs. Kane and young Howard Kane, age five. They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. (Silent Shot) (1910) Newreel shot of dignitaries on platform, with Kane, alongside of speaker's table, beaming, hand upraised to silence the crowd. (Silent Shot) (1910)
C: NARRATOR
D: Then, suddenly - less than one week before election - defeat! Shameful, ignominious - defeat that set back for twenty years the cause of reform in the U.S., forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane. Then, in the third year of the Great Depression... As to all publishers, it sometimes must - to Bennett, to Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper closes! For Kane, in four short years: collapse! Eleven Kane papers, four Kane magazines merged, more sold, scrapped -
N: Newreel shot - closeup of Kane delivering a speech... (1910) The front page of a contemporary paper - a screaming headline. Twin phots of Kane and Susan. (1910) Printed title about Depression. Once more repeat the map of the USA 1932-1939. Suddenly, the cartoon goes into reverse, the empire begins to shrink, illustrating the narrator's words. The door of a newspaper office with the signs: "Closed."
C: NARRATOR
D: Then four long years more - alone in his never-finished, already decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, seldom visited, never photographed, Charles Foster Kane continued to direct his falling empire ... vainly attempting to sway, as he once did, the destinies of a nation that has ceased to listen to him ... ceased to trust him...
N: SHOTS OF XANADU. (1940) Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate figure in the sunshine. (1935)
C: NARRATOR

N: Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man. This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.
S: INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY -
N: A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen. It is dark. The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering Projection Room. This action occurs, however, only after the first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken. The shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen. NOTE: These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of the Rawlston magazines. All his enterprises are represented in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, is present also and will shortly speak up. During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really seen. Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant slanting rays of light from the projection room. A Third Man is on the telephone. We see a corner of his head and the phone.
C: THIRD MAN
D: Stand by. I'll tell you if we want to run it again.
E: at phone hangs up
C: THOMPSON'S VOICE
D: Well?
N: A short pause.
C: A MAN'S VOICE
D: It's a tough thing to do in a newsreel. Seventy years of a man's life -
N: Murmur of highly salaried assent at this. Rawlston walks toward camera and out of the picture. Others are rising. Camera during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action and pick up faces, but fails. Actually, all set-ups are to be planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the screen.
C: A VOICE
D: See what Arthur Ellis wrote about him in the American review?
C: THIRD MAN
D: I read it.
C: THE VOICE
D: Listen: Kane is dead. He contributed to the journalism of his day - the talent of a mountebank, the morals of a bootlegger, and the manners of a pasha. He and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security - no longer secure.
E: its owner is already leaning across the table, holding a piece of paper under the desk light and reading from it
C: ANOTHER VOICE
D: That's what Arthur Ellis is writing now. Thirty years ago, when Kane gave him his chance to clean up Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, Kane was the greatest guy in the world. If you ask me -

N: Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow from the projection room.
C: RAWLSTON
D: What were Kane's last words?
N: A silence greets this.
C: RAWLSTON
D: What were the last words he said on earth? Thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character -
C: SOMEBODY'S VOICE
D: Motivation -
C: RAWLSTON
D: That's it - motivation. What made Kane what he was? And, for that matter, what was he? What we've just seen are the outlines of a career - what's behind the career? What's the man? Was he good or bad? Strong or foolish? Tragic or silly? Why did he do all those things? What was he after? Maybe he told us on his death bed.
E: then, appreciating his point
C: THOMPSON
D: Yes, and maybe he didn't.
C: RAWLSTON
D: Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
C: THOMPSON
D: I know, but -
C: RAWLSTON
D: All we saw on that screen was a big American -
E: riding over him like any other producer
C: A VOICE
D: One of the biggest.
C: RAWLSTON
D: But how is he different from Ford? Or Hearst for that matter? Or Rockefeller - or John Doe?
E: without pausing for this
C: A VOICE
D: I know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspaper business - look how he raised salaries. You don't want to forget -
C: ANOTHER VOICE
D: You take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog.
C: RAWLSTON
D: I tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words -

D: What were they?
N: Silence.
C: SOMEBODY'S VOICE
D: Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's dying words?
E: hesitant
C: RAWLSTON
D: Rosebud!
E: with disgust
N: A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced by Rawlston.
C: RAWLSTON
D: That's right.
C: A VOICE
D: Tough guy, huh? Dies calling for Rosebud!
E: derisively
C: RAWLSTON
D: Here's a man who might have been President. He's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called "Rosebud." What does that mean?
C: ANOTHER VOICE
D: A racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in - Rosebud!
C: RAWLSTON
D: All right. But what was the race?
N: There is a short silence.
C: RAWLSTON
D: Thompson!
C: THOMPSON
D: Yes, sir.
C: RAWLSTON
D: Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
C: THOMPSON
D: But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days it might be better than if -
E: feebly
C: RAWLSTON
D: Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. Go after the people that knew Kane well. That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
E: decisively pauses
N: The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
C: RAWLSTON
D: Good!
E: rising
N: The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's picture on the screen.
C: RAWLSTON'S VOICE
D: It'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing...
T: FADE OUT:
N: NOTE: Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with the people who knew Kane. It is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality. Until then, throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice. He is not until the final scene a "character". He is the personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster Kane. He is the investigator.

S: EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT -
N: 1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN The first image to register is a sign: "EL RANCHO" FLOOR SHOW SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE TWICE NIGHTLY These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at the end of the fade out. Then there is lightning which reveals a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands. Thunder again, and faintly the sound of music from within. A light glows from a skylight. The camera moves to this and closes in. Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down into the interior of the cabaret. Directly below us at a table sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

S: INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT -
N: Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink she started to take above. It is Susie. The music, of course, is now very loud. Thompson, his back to the camera, moves into the picture in the close foreground. A Captain appears behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
E: a Greek
N: Susan looks up into Thompson's face. She is fifty, trying to look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously generous evening dress. Blinking up into Thompson's face, she throws a crink into ther mouth. Her eyes, which she thinks is keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.
C: SUSAN
D: I want another drink, John.
E: to the Captain
N: Low thunder from outside.
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
E: seeing his chance

D: I'll have a highball.
E: staring to sit down

D: Who told you you could sit down here?
E: so insistently as to make Thompson change his mind and stand up again
C: THOMPSON
D: Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
C: SUSAN
D: Think again!
N: There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the Captain.
C: SUSAN
D: Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business. You mind yours.
C: THOMPSON
D: If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
C: SUSAN
D: Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
E: almost hysterical
N: Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'm sorry. Maybe some other time -
N: If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error. He nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -

D: Get her another highball.
E: to the waiter
C: THE WAITER
D: Another double?
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: Yes.
E: after a moment, pityingly
N: They walk to the door.
C: THOMPSON
D: She's plastered, isn't she?
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'll come down in a week or so and see her again. Say, you might be able to help me. When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: Rosebud?
N: Thompson has just handed him a bill. The Captain pockets it.
C: THE CAPTAIN
D: Thank you, sir. As a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon, when it was in all the papers - I asked her. She never heard of Rosebud.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -
N: An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself executed in expensive marble. He is shown seated on one of those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his stone eyes fixed on the camera. We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on which the monument is founded. The words, "Walter Parks Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon. Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish spinnster, seated behind her desk. Thompson, his hat in his hand, is standing before her. Bertha is on the phone.
C: BERTHA
D: Yes. I'll take him in now. The directors of the Thatcher Library have asked me to remind you again of the condition under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs. Under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you.
E: into phone hangs up and looks at Thompson
C: THOMPSON
D: That's all right.
C: BERTHA
D: You may come with me.
N: Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door. Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
S: INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -
N: A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb. As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's shoulders the length of the room. Everything very plain, very much made out of marble and very gloomy. Illumination from a skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and classical despair. The floor is marble, and there is a gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything. Beyond this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal of Walter P. Thatcher. He brings it to Bertha as if he were the guardian of a bullion shipment. During this, Bertha has been speaking.
C: BERTHA
D: Pages eighty-three to one hundred and forty-two, Jennings.
E: to the guard
C: GUARD
D: Yes, Miss Anderson.
C: BERTHA
D: You will confine yourself, it is our understanding, to the chapter dealing with Mr. Kane.
E: to Thompson
C: THOMPSON
D: That's all I'm interested in.
N: The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal. Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.
C: BERTHA
D: You will be required to leave this room at four-thirty promptly.
N: She leaves. Thompson starts to light a cigarette. The guard shakes his head. With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the manuscript. Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of manuscript. Manuscript, neatly and precisely written: "CHARLES FOSTER KANE WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY. A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD... THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE. IN THE WINTER OF 1870..." The camera has not held on the entire page. It has been following the words with the same action that the eye does the reading. On the last words, the white page of the paper

S: EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a parlor window. In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like an animated cartoon). He is in the act of throwing a snowball at the camera. It sails toward us and over our heads, out of scene. Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading: MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING INQUIRE WITHIN Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign.
S: INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is not cut into scene. We see only the field of snow again, same angle as in previous scene. Charles is manufacturing another snowball. Now - Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse. Mrs. Kane, aged about 28, is looking out towards her son. Just as we take her in she speaks:
C: MRS. KANE
D: Be careful, Charles!
E: calling out
C: THATCHER'S VOICE
D: Mrs. Kane -
C: MRS. KANE
D: Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles -
E: Calling out the window almost on top of this
N: But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to this and is running away. Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we see her face - a strong face, worn and kind.
C: THATCHER'S VOICE
D: think we'll have to tell him now -
N: Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of official-looking documents. He is 26 and, as might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.
C: MRS. KANE
D: I'll sign those papers -
C: KANE SR.
D: You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
N: At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and the camera pulls back still further, taking him in. Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak. From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.
C: MRS. KANE
D: It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
C: KANE SR.
D: If I want to, I can go to court. father has a right to -
C: THATCHER
D: Mr. Kane, the certificates that Mr. Graves left here are made out to Mrs. Kane, in her name. Hers to do with as she pleases -
E: annoyed
C: KANE SR.
D: Well, I don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because -
C: MRS. KANE
D: I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
E: quietly
C: THATCHER
D: The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final.
E: clears his throat
C: KANE SR.
D: The idea of a bank being the guardian -
N: Mrs. Kane has met his eye. Her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to finish his sentence.
C: MRS. KANE
D: I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
E: even more quietly
C: THATCHER
D: We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
N: Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, but chokes down his opinion.
C: MRS. KANE
D: Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
E: has been reading past Thatcher's shoulder as he talked
C: THATCHER
D: Right here, Mrs. Kane.
C: KANE SR.
D: Don't say I didn't warn you.
E: sulkily
N: Mrs. Kane lifts the quill pen.
C: KANE SR.
D: Mary, I'm asking you for the last time - anyon'd think I hadn't been a good husband and a -
N: Mrs. Kane looks at him slowly. He stops his speech.
C: THATCHER
D: The sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and Mr. Kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor -
N: Mrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs.
C: KANE SR.
D: Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
C: MRS. KANE
D: It is. Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
N: Mrs. Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice. Thatcher is aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, and of Mrs. Kane's divided attention. As he pauses, Kane Sr. genteelly walks over to close the window.
S: EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window. He is advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to one knee the better to confound his adversary.
C: KANE
D: If the rebels want a fight boys, let's give it to 'em!
N: He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and advances another five feet before getting on his knees again.
C: KANE
D: The terms are underconditional surrender. Up and at 'em! The Union forever!
S: INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Kane Sr. closes the window.
C: THATCHER
D: Everything else - the principal as well as all monies earned - is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane, until his twenty-fifth birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession.
E: over the boy's voice
N: Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window.
C: MRS. KANE
D: Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
N: Thatcher continues as she opens the window. His voice, as before, is heard with overtones of the boy's.
S: EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. Kane's position at the window. He is now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left which he is holding back in his right hand.
C: KANE
D: You can't lick Andy Jackson! Old Hickory, that's me!
N: He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman.
C: THATCHER'S VOICE
D: It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't you think I'd better meet the boy -
S: INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Mrs. Kane at the window. Thatcher is now standing at her side.
C: MRS. KANE
D: I've got his trunk all packed - I've it packed for a couple of weeks -
E: she chokes a little
N: She can't say anymore. She starts for the hall day. Kane Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her.
C: THATCHER
D: I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago. I'd have brought him along with me, but you were so anxious to keep everything secret -
N: He stops as he realizes that Mrs. Kane has paid no attention to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the hall that leads to the side door of the house. He takes a look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. Kane. Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, follows him.
S: EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
N: Kane, in the snow-covered field. With the snowman between him and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop. The Kane house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story frame building, with a wooden outhouse. Kane looks up as he sees the single file procession, Mrs. Kane at its head, coming toward him.
C: KANE
D: H'ya, Mom.
N: Mrs. Kane smiles.
C: KANE
D: See, Mom? I took the pipe out of his mouth. If it keeps on snowin', maybe I'll make some teeth and -
E: gesturing at the snowman
C: MRS. KANE
D: You better come inside, son. You and I have got to get you all ready for - for -
C: THATCHER
D: Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
C: MRS. KANE
D: This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
C: THATCHER
D: How do you do, Charles?
C: KANE SR.
D: He comes from the east.
C: KANE
D: Hello. Hello, Pop.
C: KANE SR.
D: Hello, Charlie!
C: MRS. KANE
D: Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
C: KANE SR.
D: That's the train with all the lights.
C: KANE
D: You goin', Mom?
C: THATCHER
D: Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
C: KANE
D: Where'm I going?
C: KANE SR.
D: You're going to see Chicago and New York - and Washington, maybe... Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?
C: THATCHER
D: He certainly is. I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time.
E: heartily
C: KANE
D: Why aren't you comin' with us, Mom?
C: MRS. KANE
D: We have to stay here, Charles.
C: KANE SR.
D: You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie! You're going to be rich. Your Ma figures - that is, re - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
C: MRS. KANE
D: You won't be lonely, Charles...
C: THATCHER
D: We're going to have a lot of good times together, Charles... Really we are.
N: Kane stares at him.
C: THATCHER
D: Come on, Charles. Let's shake hands. Now, now! I'm not as frightening as all that! Let's shake, what do you say?
E: extends his hand. Charles continues to look at him
N: He reaches out for Charles's hand. Without a word, Charles hits him in the stomach with the sled. Thatcher stumbles back a few feet, gasping.
C: THATCHER
D: You almost hurt me, Charles. Sleds aren't to hit people with. Sleds are to - to sleigh on. When we get to New York, Charles, we'll get you a sled that will -
E: with a sickly grin moves towards him
N: He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder. As he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle.
C: MRS. KANE
D: Charles!
N: He throws himself on her, his arms around her. Slowly Mrs. Kane puts her arms around him.
C: KANE
D: Mom! Mom!
E: frightened
C: MRS. KANE
D: It's all right, Charles, it's all right.
N: Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over to rub his ankle.
C: KANE SR.
D: Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
C: MRS. KANE
D: That's what you think, is it, Jim?
C: KANE SR.
D: Yes.
N: Mrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane.
C: MRS. KANE
D: That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.

T: DISSOLVE OUT:
N: The white page of the Thatcher manuscript. We pick up the words: "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, IRRESPONSIBLE." The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy (as in following scene).
S: INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY -
N: Close-up on printed headline which reads: "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST" Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" copy, on which we read the headline. He is standing near the editorial round table around which a section of the staff, including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch.
C: THATCHER
D: Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
E: coldly
C: KANE
D: I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
C: THATCHER
D: "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast." You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
E: reading headline of paper he is still holding
C: KANE
D: Can you prove it isn't?
N: Bernstein has come into the picture. He has a cable in his hand. He stops when he sees Thatcher.
C: KANE
D: Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
C: THATCHER
D: How do you do? -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. Kane -
E: stops, embarrassed
C: KANE
D: That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
E: reading
C: THATCHER
D: You see! There hasn't been a true word -
C: KANE
D: I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. Let me see - Mike!
E: snaps his fingers
C: MIKE
D: Go ahead, Mr. Kane.
E: a fairly tough customer prepares to take dictation, his mouth still full of food
C: KANE
D: Dear Wheeler - You provide the prose poems - I'll provide the war.
E: pauses a moment
N: Laughter from the boys and girls at the table.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: That's fine, Mr. Kane.
C: KANE
D: I rather like it myself. Send it right away.
C: MIKE
D: Right away.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Right away.
N: Mike and Bernstein leave. Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, who is bursting with indignation but controls himself. After a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try.
C: THATCHER
D: I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
C: KANE
D: Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
N: They cross the City Room together.
C: THATCHER
D: I think I should remind you, Charles, of a fact you seem to have forgotten. You are yourself one of the largest individual stockholders.
S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY -
N: Kane holds the door open for Thatcher. They come in together.
C: KANE
D: Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
C: THATCHER
D: They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
E: angrily
C: KANE
D: The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
N: Kane moves around behind his desk. Thatcher doesn't understand, looks at him.
C: KANE
D: As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty-two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
C: THATCHER
D: Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
E: angrily
C: KANE
D: On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property -
E: his manner becomes serious
N: Thatcher doesn't understand him.
C: KANE
D: If I don't defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will - maybe somebody without any money or any property and that would be too bad.
N: Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer. Kane starts to dance.
C: KANE
D: Do you know how to tap, Mr. Thatcher? You ought to learn -
E: humming quietly, he continues to dance
N: Thatcher puts on his hat.
C: THATCHER
D: I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles. Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
E: sneeringly
C: KANE
D: You're right. We did lose a million dollars last year.
N: Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered.
C: KANE
D: We expect to lost a million next year, too. You know, Mr. Thatcher - at the rate of a million a year - we'll have to close this place in sixty years.

Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out. Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style.
C: MISS ANDERSON
D: You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man. Did you find what you were looking for?
C: THOMPSON
D: No. Tell me something, Miss Anderson. You're not Rosebud, are you?
C: MISS ANDERSON
D: What?

N: Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five. Camera pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall. Over the picture are crossed American flags. Under it sits Bernstein, back of his desk. Bernstein, always an undersized Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth. He is bald as an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes. As camera continues to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders come into the picture.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ... What do you want to know?
E: wryly
C: THOMPSON
D: Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
E: still explaining
C: BERNSTEIN
D: From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
E: turns to Thompson
C: THOMPSON
D: - We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
C: THOMPSON
D: Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. See what I mean? Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
E: remembers the name slowly triumphantly smiles
C: THOMPSON
D: I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Who else you been to see?
C: THOMPSON
D: Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
E: sadly
C: THOMPSON
D: You know why? She was so -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Sure, sure.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'm going back there.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Who else did you see?
C: THOMPSON
D: Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
C: THOMPSON
D: He made an awful lot of money.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!
E: his eyes get reflective
N: Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: He never knew there was anything in the world but money. That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money... Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business!

He had that funny sense of humor. Sometimes even I didn't get the joke. Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... That was years later, of course - 1914 it was. Mrs. Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible. But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics. Mr. Kane was a big man in those days. But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland -

C: CITY EDITOR
D: What about Branford Leland? Has he got in his copy?
E: turns to a young hireling; quietly
C: HIRELING
D: Not yet.

E: after a pause
C: BERNSTEIN
D: That's right. They called us the "Three Musketeers."
E: with a smile
N: Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter. The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.

E: he isn't saying
C: ANOTHER HIRELING
D: Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between -
E: a tactless one

E: quickly then, somberly turning to City Editor
C: CITY EDITOR
D: Yes. I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.

D: And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?

C: CITY EDITOR
D: Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.
C: KANE
D: And the notice?
E: very, very casually
C: CITY EDITOR
D: Yes - Mr. Kane.
C: KANE
D: Is it good?
E: quietly
C: CITY EDITOR
D: Yes, Mr. kane.
N: Kane looks at him for a minute.
C: CITY EDITOR
D: But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
C: KANE
D: It isn't finished?
E: sharply
C: CITY EDITOR
D: No, Mr. Kane.
C: KANE
D: That's Leland, isn't it?
C: CITY EDITOR
D: Yes, Mr. Kane.
C: KANE
D: Has he said when he'll finish?
C: CITY EDITOR
D: We haven't heard from him.
C: KANE
D: He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: He sure did, Mr. Kane.
C: KANE
D: Where is he?
C: ANOTHER HIRELING
D: Right in there, Mr. Kane.
N: The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office at the other end of the City Room. Kane takes it in.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: MR. KANE -
E: helpless, but very concerned
C: KANE
D: That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
N: Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass door indicated before by the Hireling. The City Editor looks at Bernstein. Kane opens the door and goes into the office, closing the door behind him.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years. Excuse me.
E: long pause; finally starts toward the door
S: INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -
N: Bernstein comes in. An empty bottle is standing on Leland's desk. He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys. A sheet of paper is in the machine. A paragraph has been typed. Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on him. This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face. Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland. He shakes him.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
E: he straightens, looks at Kane; pause
C: KANE
D: What does it say there?
E: finally; after a pause
N: Bernstein stares at him.
C: KANE
D: What's he written?
N: Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the paragraph written on the page.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
E: reading he waits for a minute to catch his breath; he doesn't like it looks up miserably
C: KANE
D: Thais.
N: Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: "Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
E: reading again he continues to stare at the page
C: KANE
D: Go on!
E: after a short silence
C: BERNSTEIN
D: That's all there is.
E: without looking up
N: Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for himself. Slowly, a queer look comes over his face. Then he speaks, very quietly.
C: KANE
D: Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
E: then sharply
C: BERNSTEIN
D: I didn't see that.
E: miserably
C: KANE
D: It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: I can't take shorthand.
E: looks at him

D: Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.

N: Bernstein speaking to Thompson.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.
C: THOMPSON
D: I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
E: after a pause
C: BERNSTEIN
D: He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -
E: looks at him very soberly
C: THOMPSON
D: Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.

S: INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -
N: The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City Room. Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of it is actually getting into the room because the windows are small and narrow. There are about a dozen tables and desks, of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters. Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, obviously serve the city room executives. To the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum. As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new arrivals. Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises and starts toward them.
C: CARTER
D: Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
C: KANE
D: Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
C: CARTER
D: How do you do, Mr. Leland?
E: bowing
C: KANE
D: Are they standing for me?
E: pointing to the standing reporters
C: CARTER
D: I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher -
C: KANE
D: Ask them to sit down.
E: grinning
C: CARTER
D: You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
E: to Kane
C: KANE
D: I don't my plans myself.
N: They are following Carter to his raised platform.
C: KANE
D: As a matter of fact, I haven't got any. Except to get out a newspaper.
N: There is a terrific crash at the doorway. They all turn to see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance. A roll of bedding, a suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.
C: KANE
D: Oh, Mr. Bernstein!
N: Bernstein looks up.
C: KANE
D: If you would come here a moment, please, Mr. Bernstein?
N: Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.
C: KANE
D: Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
C: CARTER
D: How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
E: frigidly
C: KANE
D: You've got a private office here, haven't you?
N: The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the bedstead and other furniture. He is looking about, a bit bewildered.
C: CARTER
D: My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
E: indicating open door to left of platform
C: KANE
D: I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
E: reflectively
C: CARTER
D: But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
C: KANE
D: That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY -
N: Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal at the same time. Carter, still formally coated, is seated alongside him. Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, detached, amused. The furniture has been pushed around and Kane's effects are somewhat in place. On a corner of the desk, Bernstein is writing down figures. No one pays any attention to him.
C: KANE
D: I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
E: points to it looks to make sure of the name
C: CARTER
D: Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
E: stiffly
N: Kane has finished eating. He pushes away his plates.
C: KANE
D: I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?
E: pointing to the "Chronicle" before him
C: CARTER
D: There is no news big enough.
C: KANE
D: If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
C: CARTER
D: As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter. And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
E: hotly triumphantly
C: KANE
D: The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
E: smiling a bit
C: CARTER
D: It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
E: stiffly
C: KANE
D: That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
E: gently he gets an idea
N: Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
C: CARTER
D: Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
N: Kane isn't listening to him.
C: KANE
D: Oh, Mr. Bernstein!
N: Bernstein looks up from his figures.
C: KANE
D: I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
C: BERNSTEIN
D: I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
N: Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein. Leland grins back. Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.
C: CARTER
D: But, Mr. Kane -
C: KANE
D: That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
N: Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves the room, closing the door behind him.
C: LELAND
D: Poor Mr. Carter!
C: KANE
D: What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
E: shakes his head
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Three cents.
E: without looking up
C: KANE
D: Two cents.
E: calmly
N: Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane. Kane gazes back at him.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: This is all figured at three cents a copy.
E: tapping on the paper
C: KANE
D: Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
E: sighs and puts papers in his pocket
C: KANE
D: Ready for dinner, Brad?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
C: LELAND
D: I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Who said anything about brooms?
C: KANE
D: It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.

S: INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER -
N: NIGHT - The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the "Enquirer." It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock on the wall. Grouped around a large table, on which are several locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the composing room foreman, nervous and harassed.
C: SMATHERS
D: But it's impossible, Mr. Kane. We can't remake these pages.
C: KANE
D: These pages aren't made up as I want them, Mr. Smathers. We go to press in five minutes.
C: CARTER
D: The "Enquirer" has an old and honored tradition, Mr. Kane... The "Enquirer" is not in competition with those other rags.
E: about to crack up
C: BERNSTEIN
D: We should be publishing such rags, that's all I wish. Why, the "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up the liver for the cat in the "Enquirer" -
C: CARTER
D: Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to it that this - this person learns to control his tongue.
E: enraged
N: Kane looks up.
C: CARTER
D: I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
E: he starts to sputter he's really sore
C: KANE
D: It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
C: CARTER
D: But Mr. Kane, I meant -
N: Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room foreman.
C: KANE
D: Let's remake these pages, Mr. Smathers. We'll have to publish a half hour late, that's all.
E: quietly
C: SMATHERS
D: We can't remake them, Mr. Kane. We go to press in five minutes.
E: as though Kane were talking Greek
N: Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter into hundreds of bits.
C: KANE
D: You can remake them now, can't you, Mr. Smathers?
N: Smather's mouth opens wider and wider. Bradford and Bernstein are grinning.
C: KANE
D: After the types 've been reset and the pages have been remade according to the way I told you before, Mr. Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled and bring them to me. Then, if I can't find any way to improve them again - - I suppose we'll have to go to press.
E: almost as if reluctantly
N: He starts out of the room, followed by Leland.

D: In case you don't understand, Mr. Smathers - he's a new broom.
E: to Smathers

S: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -
N: The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against the sunrise. We do not see the street or the first few stories of this building, the windows of which would be certainly illuminated. What we do see is the floor on which is located the City Room. Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the Chronicle, their voices growing in volume. As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -
N: The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter but very insistent. Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the Enquirer building. Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out. The bed is already made up. On it is seated Bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar. Leland is in a chair.
C: NEWSBOYS' VOICES
D: CHRONICLE! CHRONICLE! H'YA - THE CHRONICLE - GET YA! CHRONICLE!
N: Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others. The voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this.
C: LELAND
D: We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
E: looking at his watch
N: Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.
C: KANE
D: Tired?
C: LELAND
D: It's been a tough day.
C: KANE
D: A wasted day.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Wasted?
E: looking up
C: LELAND
D: Charlie?!
E: incredulously
C: BERNSTEIN
D: You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all -
C: KANE
D: I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
C: LELAND
D: What're you going to do, Charlie?
E: quietly
N: Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration.
C: KANE
D: My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
E: he says it with quotes around it getting the idea
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
C: KANE
D: I'll write it myself.
N: Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon. Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
E: looking over his shoulder
C: KANE
D: These'll be kept. I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. will also provide them -
E: as he writes stops for a minute and reads what he has written; reading starts to write again; reading as he writes
C: LELAND
D: That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
C: KANE
D: People are going to know who's responsible. And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
E: looking up he speaks with real conviction
N: He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes. Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane. They both stand looking out. Leland joins him on the other side. Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky. Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette. Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with heading: MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of newspapers. As we draw further back, we see four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution. A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000" passes through foreground, and we wipe to: A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner, obviously a poor district. A couple of coins fall on the pile. The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls. Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel. A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop. A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine. Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer". Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the front page. The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by. On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent. Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, showing state distribution. The railroad platform again. We stay here for four images. On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the "Enquirer" are larger. On the first image, we move in to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000." We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000. In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased. The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train. The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on the "Enquirer" masthead changes to:
S: EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -
N: Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign advertising the "Enquirer." It reads: THE ENQUIRER THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION 62,000 Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building on which there is a sign which reads: READ THE ENQUIRER AMERICA'S FINEST CIRCULATION 62,000 Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the Chronicle office. The Chronicle office has a plateglass window in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching peanuts. Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the center. A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE. A sign beneath it reads: GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD. The sign also includes the "Chronicle" circulation figure. There are nine men in the photo.

The men, variously with mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them. As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room. It is 1:30 at night. Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall. Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, at which twenty diners have finished their meals. The eleven remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.

C: KANE
D: Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.

D: Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
N: General applause.
C: KANE
D: All of you - new and old - You're all getting the best salaries in town. Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in. That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world!
N: Applause.
C: KANE
D: However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. There are other subjects in the world.
N: He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle. This is a signal. A band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus costumes of the day. The rest of this episode will be planned and staged later. Its essence is that Kane is just a healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.

Kane is shown, thus, at various activities: Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)- A torchlight parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time." In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER THE MAINE" INSERT: Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats are seen marching off to war. Back of observation car. Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without flickering). The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate that it is going like a bat out of hell. A reproduction of Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the frame and almost hogs the entire front page. The headline indicates the surrender of Cuba.

N: Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a street corner (Stock).

N: A black pattern of iron bars. We are in a prison cell. The door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob- sister, and Kane. The photographers take pictures with a mighty flash of old-fashioned flash powder. The condemned man in the foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table. A big lay-out of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won its campaign for better equipment. A cup of coffee and a doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee. The Beaux Art Ball. A number of elderly swells are jammed into a hallway. Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, very lavish and very very ridiculous. We see, among others, Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head and all. At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of the "New York Enquirer." Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a pretty repulsive sight. The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can. Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST." Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality. Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.
S: EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -
N: As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner. Behind the principles can be seen an enormous plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS." From offstage can be heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the rest of it.
C: THE OFFICIAL
D: There you are, Mr. Kane. Everything in order.
C: KANE
D: Thank you.
N: Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank.
C: THE OFFICIAL
D: Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.
E: calling
C: KANE
D: Thanks.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
C: KANE
D: I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
C: STEWARD'S VOICE
D: All ashore!
C: KANE
D: - and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections.
C: STEWARD'S VOICE
D: All ashore that's going ashore!
N: Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he rushes up to it, calling back with a wave:
C: KANE
D: Goodbye, gents! Hey!
E: at the top of the gangplank, he turns and calls down
C: KANE
D: You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
E: calling down to them
N: A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne." Bernstein and Leland turn to each other.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Do you, Mr. Leland?
C: LELAND
D: Certainly not.
E: smiling
N: They start down the gangplank together.

N: LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER." A couple of lights show in the building. We start toward the window where the lights show, as we -
T: DISSOLVE:
S: EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT
N: The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign. Now the letter "E" is even larger than the frame of the camera. Rain drips disconsolately off the middle part of the figure. We see through this and through the drizzle of the window to Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded light.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
N: Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and late in the winter of the year. The outline "E" is hung with icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: Same setup as before except that it is spring. Instead of the sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below. It is spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working at his desk. Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill. Bernstein looks up and sees them. He takes some crumbs from his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row. The birds eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.
T: DISSOLVE:
N: The same setup again, it is now summer. The window was half- open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has gone so far as to take off his coat. His shirt and his celluloid collar are wringing wet. Camera moves toward the window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room behind him, which is absolutely deserted. It is clear that there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do. The hurdy- gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.

N: A beach on Coney Island. Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer."

S: INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -
N: The whole floor is now a City Room. It is twice its former size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using them. The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal more light and air. A wall calendar says September 9th. Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment. Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear- eyed and tanned. He is wearing new English clothes. As they come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son. Seeing and recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.
C: KANE
D: Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
E: referring to the staff; with a smile
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
N: The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business of feverish activity.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers -
C: KANE
D: We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
E: he indicates a woman at the desk
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Huh? Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
N: He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's desk. The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend she isn't aware of him. An envelope in her hand shakes violently. Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Miss Townsend -
N: Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein with a stranger.
C: MISS TOWNSEND
D: Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.
N: Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan. She starts to rise, but her legs are none too good under her. She knocks over a tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.
C: KANE
D: Miss Townsend -
E: very hesitatingly and very softly
N: At the sound of his voice, she straightens up. She is very close to death from excitement.
C: KANE
D: I've been away for several months, and I don't know exactly how these things are handled now. But one thing I wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement.
N: He hands her an envelope. She has difficulty in holding on to it.
C: KANE
D: Read it, Miss Townsend. And remember - just the regular treatment! See you at nine o'clock, Mr. Bernstein!
E: gently
N: Kane leaves. Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper. Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope. A piece of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.
C: MISS TOWNSEND
D: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to Mr. Charles Foster Kane.
E: reading
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce -
E: starts to read it
C: MISS TOWNSEND
D: She's - she's the niece of - of the President of the United States -
E: fluttering - on top of him
C: BERNSTEIN
D: know. Come on, Miss Townsend - From the window, maybe we can get a look.
E: nodding proudly
N: He takes her by the hand and leads her off. Angle toward open window. Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs to camera, rushing to the window.
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -
N: High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see from the window. Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton. He kisses her full on the lips before he sits down. She acts a bit taken aback, because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really annoyed. As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him adoringly. He, however, has turned his head and is looking adoringly at the "Enquirer." He apparently sees Bernstein and Miss Townsed and waves his hand.
S: INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY -
N: Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: A girl like that, believe me, she's lucky! Presiden't niece, huh! Say, before he's through, she'll be a Presiden't wife.

C: BERNSTEIN
D: The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
C: THOMPSON
D: It didn't end very well, did it?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. guess he didn't make her very happy -
E: shaking his head a slight pause shrugs, a pause; then looking up into Thompson's eyes
N: (A PAUSE) You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
C: THOMPSON
D: Yes -
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
E: a pause
C: THOMPSON
D: In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: You don't say! Why I had no idea -
C: THOMPSON
D: Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just -
E: controls himself
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
E: smiles sadly pauses
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -
N: Close shot - Thompson. He is tilted back in a chair which seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney. Leland's voice is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen.
C: LELAND'S VOICE
D: When you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything. Unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon. Even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years.
N: Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to Thompson. They are on the flat roof of a hospital. Other people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along with a nurse or two. They are all sunning themselves.
C: THOMPSON
D: Mr. Leland, you were -
C: LELAND
D: You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself. He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away. He just - left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant. Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
E: grinning looks sharply at Thompson
C: THOMPSON
D: Sorry, Mr. Leland.
C: LELAND
D: Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
C: THOMPSON
D: Maybe you could remember something that -
C: LELAND
D: I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. Memory - I was his oldest friend. As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. Maybe I wasnt' his friend. If I wasn't, he never had one. Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
E: slowly

S: INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -
N: The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence). We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of the table. Kane is heard off, making a speech.
C: KANE'S VOICE
D: Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in. That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world!
N: Applause. During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!
C: LELAND
D: Yes.
N: His tone causes Bernstein to look at him.
C: KANE'S VOICE
D: However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night.
N: The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: What's the matter?
E: to Leland
C: LELAND
D: Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
E: proudly
C: KANE
D: There are other subjects in the world -
E: finishing his speech
N: Kane whistles. The band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein.
C: LELAND
D: Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
E: after a minute
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
E: indignantly
C: LELAND
D: Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
N: Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein. He sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette.
C: KANE
D: Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
C: LELAND
D: Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
C: KANE
D: It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
E: enthusiastically gets excited quoting
C: LELAND
D: But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
C: KANE
D: All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
E: looking up
N: Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, stands behind him. She leans over and speaks quietly in his ear.
C: GEORGIE
D: Is everything the way you want it, dear?
C: KANE
D: If everybody's having fun, that's the way I want it.
E: looking around
C: GEORGIE
D: I've got some other little girls coming over -
C: LELAND
D: Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
E: interrupting
C: KANE
D: How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
E: seriously
C: LELAND
D: They do it only because you do!
C: KANE
D: And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
E: grins rises
N: Leland nods.
C: GEORGIE
D: Glad to meet you, Brad.
E: over Kane's next lines
N: Leland shudders.
C: KANE
D: I told you about Brad, Georgie. He needs to relax.
N: Brad doesn't answer.
C: KANE
D: Some ships with wonderful wines have managed to slip through the enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - Georgie knows a young lady whom I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't he, Georgie? Why only the other evening I said to myself, if Brad were only here to adore this young lady - this - What's her name again?

C: ETHEL
D: Hello, Mr. Leland.
N: Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls gathered around him.
C: ONE OF THE GIRLS
D: Charlie! Play the song about you.
C: ANOTHER GIRL
D: Is there a song about Charlie?
N: Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls start to sing. Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the group. Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the professor who has been standing next to him to take over. The professor does so. The singing continues. Kane rises and crosses to Leland.
C: KANE
D: Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
E: draws him slightly aside
C: LELAND
D: Yes?
C: KANE
D: I mean I've got a job for you.
C: LELAND
D: Good.
C: KANE
D: You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
C: LELAND
D: I'd like that.
E: sincerely, but not gushing; seriously
N: Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music. Leland smiles at him.
C: KANE
D: You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken." I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free, you know. Rector's at seven?
E: or supply show grins
C: LELAND
D: Charlie -
C: KANE
D: Yes?
C: LELAND
D: It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
E: still smiling
C: KANE
D: You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
E: has stopped dancing starts to dance again

N: Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's. Popular music is heard over the soundtrack. Everybody is laughing very, very hard at something Kane has said. The girls are hysterical. Kane can hardly breathe. As Leland's laughter becomes more and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others.

S: EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -
N: As told by Bernstein. Kane is calling down to Leland and Bernstein (as before).
C: KANE
D: You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
N: A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to- shore conversation is rendered unfeasible. Bernstein and Leland on deck.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Do you, Mr. Leland?
E: turns to Leland
C: LELAND
D: Certainly not.
E: smiling
N: Slight pause. They continue on their way.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to. He said to me just yesterday -
C: LELAND
D: I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
N: This stops Bernstein. Bernstein looks at him.
C: LELAND
D: Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Don't I always? Most of the time?
C: LELAND
D: Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Yes.
N: Leland is surprised.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
C: LELAND
D: You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. You always have been.
E: good naturedly
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time!
N: He pauses. "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck of the department steamer.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
E: with a hopeful look in his eyes
C: LELAND
D: September the ninth?
N: Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write. Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p.m."

D: It's a letter from her lawyers.

E: reading aloud from the letter looks up
C: THOMPSON
D: Rawlston is my boss.
C: LELAND
D: Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
C: THOMPSON
D: He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially - That's the answer we got.
C: LELAND
D: I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane.
E: reading
N: She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget. With assurances of the highest esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson.
C: LELAND
D: Brief marriage! Ten years!
E: sighs
C: THOMPSON
D: Was he in love?
C: LELAND
D: He married for love - That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give. He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her. As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are. I guess there's more than two sides -

C: THE PRESIDENT
D: It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
E: pauses
C: KANE
D: I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks!
C: THE PRESIDENT

The montage ends on the word TREASON. The music cuts. A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - recognizably the "Enquirer." The hand removes a gun. The gun is shot. Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun still firing. As the arm is raised in the air, we see that the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are uniformed, and we see the White House beyond.

N: News ticker which is spelling out the words: "ASSASSINATED 7:45 P.M." NOTE: Under the following - a down shot, below the "Enquirer," shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera. Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music. A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show:
S: INT. OF KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -
N: The ticker tape is in Reilly's hand. Reilly has a phone to his ear.
C: REILLY
D: Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane. How shall we handle it?
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
S: INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE -
N: Kane in shirtsleeves at phone.
C: KANE
D: It's a news story! Get it on the street!
T: DISSOLVE:
N: Headline under "Enquirer" masthead which reads: "PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED" Newsboy is crying the headline at the same time. We pull back to show him and -

S: INT. THEATRE - NIGHT
N: The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family and friends. On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music. Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily. He has a copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand. Emily rises. He shows the paper to her.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -
N: An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office. They make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the following scene. Across the heads of the crowd are two great squares of light from the windows above them. One of these disappears as the blind is pulled. As the dissolve completes itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland pulls down, covering the entire frame.
S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -
N: The staff standing around, worried to death, in their shirtsleeves.
C: KANE
D: Take dictation - Front page editorial - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated. He was the President of the United States -"
E: to Reilly
C: LELAND
D: Charlie -
C: KANE
D: Yes?
C: LELAND
D: Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
C: KANE
D: Why not?
C: LELAND
D: Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
C: REILLY
D: Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
E: quickly
C: KANE
D: What do you mean by that?
E: still looking at Leland
C: LELAND
D: Competition.
E: quietly
C: REILLY
D: He may recover -
C: KANE
D: What do you mean by that?
E: still holding on Leland
C: LELAND
D: Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.
E: steadily
C: KANE
D: Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
C: LELAND
D: - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
C: KANE
D: I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
C: LELAND
D: You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
C: KANE
D: They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
C: LELAND
D: Charlie!
E: interrupting
C: KANE
D: Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -
E: riding over him
C: LELAND
D: Look out that window.
N: Kane stops - looks at him.
C: LELAND
D: There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
C: KANE
D: What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
E: snarling he turns to Reilly
C: LELAND
D: Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
C: KANE
D: I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.
E: sharply
C: LELAND
D: What?
C: KANE
D: I've got to think of Emily -
C: LELAND
D: I'd like to talk to you about that.
E: after a silence
C: KANE
D: Go ahead.
N: Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing around.
C: LELAND
D: Finish your editorial.
N: Leland walks out in to the City Room. More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic. Leland goes to his desk, takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink. A door opens. A Policeman enters with Bernstein. Bernstein is badly battered. The boys crowd around.
C: LELAND
D: What's happened?
E: worried
C: BERNSTEIN
D: I'm all right, Mr. Leland. Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
E: smiling
C: THE COP
D: You sure did - Say, the Commissioner said I was to stand by and protect Mr. Kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it. Where is he?
E: grinning
C: LELAND
D: In there.
E: finishing his drink
C: BERNSTEIN
D: If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
C: LELAND
D: Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
E: pouring himself another drink he looks his face over thoroughly
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
C: LELAND
D: Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
N: Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance. Leland finishes his second drink.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -
N: The bottle is finished. The door in the Sanctrum opens. Reilly and the others leave.
C: REILLY
D: Goodnight, Mr. Kane.
E: as they go
N: Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland. Leland gets up and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from Kane at the desk. An uncomfortable pause. Then Kane smiles ingratiatingly. Leland tries to cope with this.
C: LELAND
D: First of all -
E: he can't go on
C: KANE
D: What's wrong, Brad?
E: not cruelly - genuinely kind
C: LELAND
D: I'm drunk.
C: KANE
D: I'll get you some coffee.
N: He rises and goes to the door.
C: LELAND
D: First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
C: KANE
D: That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you - Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
E: gently - opening the door calling
C: MIKE'S VOICE
D: Sure thing, Mr. Kane.
N: Kane turns back to Leland. Leland doesn't look up at him.
C: LELAND
D: Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
C: KANE
D: Why, Brad?
C: LELAND
D: I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That's not what I wanted to talk about.
E: he is heartsick, inarticulate
N: Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.
C: KANE
D: I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
C: LELAND
D: No, that won't help. Besides, you never get drunk. I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
N: Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.
C: KANE
D: All right.
E: quietly
C: LELAND
D: She's going to leave you -
E: without looking at him
C: KANE
D: I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
E: ruefully
C: LELAND
D: She was going to leave you anyway -
E: takes his eye
N: Kane takes this in.
C: LELAND
D: Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -
C: KANE
D: Brad, you are drunk.
E: sharply
C: LELAND
D: Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
C: KANE
D: Why is she leaving me?
C: LELAND
D: She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
E: it's very hard for him to say all this
C: KANE
D: Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
C: LELAND
D: You might have made the whole thing less personal!
E: hesitating
N: No answer from Kane.
C: LELAND
D: It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important -
N: Still no answer from Kane.
C: LELAND
D: There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
C: KANE
D: The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
C: LELAND
D: You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that. That's why you keep me around. You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals. You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
E: rising smiles
N: Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now. He speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a disease.
C: LELAND
D: You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man? You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
C: KANE
D: Are you finished?
C: LELAND
D: Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
E: looking down
C: KANE
D: You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
E: with a little smile
C: LELAND
D: That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
E: he won't be charmed out of his duty
C: KANE
D: Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
E: his face hardning a little
N: Leland has risen. He speaks as he turns away, starting towards the door.
C: LELAND
D: You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
E: he stops - his back turned to Kane
C: KANE
D: It's simpler than that, Brad. A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
N: Leland has turned, taking his eye again. Now Kane stops and smiles.
C: KANE
D: She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
C: LELAND
D: I know you will.
C: KANE
D: Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
E: with all his charm
N: Leland shakes his head. Kane lifts his glass.
C: KANE
D: To love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -
N: Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of the front toward a hansom cab. A VOICE FROM THE CROWD You moiderer! A rock is thrown. It hits Leland on the face. A little blood flows. Kane doesn't see it at first. Then when he's in the hansom cab, he turns and notices it.
C: KANE
D: Are you hurt?
N: Leland has a handkerchief to his face.
C: LELAND
D: No. I wish you'd go home to Emily. She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you -
N: The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but still hard by.
C: KANE
D: You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
C: LELAND
D: Yes.
C: KANE
D: Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
E: leaning out of the hansom cab almost as a question
C: LELAND
D: I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. We'll let the salary stay where it is.
E: with handkerchief still attached to his face
N: The hansom cab starts up. We hold on Leland's face as we

S: INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING -
N: Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples. Kane is standing at the foot of the bed. The baby's bed is in a corner of the room. The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a nurse for Emily is near her. Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, who is staring tiredly at the ceiling.
C: KANE
D: Excuse us a moment, please.
E: to the nurse
N: The nurse looks at Emily.
C: KANE
D: I said, excuse us a moment.
E: peremptorily
N: The nurse, unwilling, leaves.
C: KANE
D: I've been talking to Leland. Emily - You can't leave me now - not now -
N: Silence.
C: KANE
D: It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily - That isn't it - They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily - It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying I killed him.
N: Still silence.
C: KANE
D: That story about the murderer having a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket - the "Chronicle" made that up out of whole cloth - Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning. Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters. He -
E: bitterly
N: He stops. He sees that he's getting no place with Emily.
C: KANE
D: What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
E: exasperated
C: EMILY
D: Charles.
E: weakly
N: He waits for her to continue.
C: EMILY
D: Do you really think - Those threatening letters, can they really -
E: she can't continue
N: She sits up and looks at the crib. She almost continues to look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes.
C: KANE
D: They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
E: uncomfortably contemptuously
C: EMILY
D: Please don't talk any more, Charles.
E: turning her face toward him
N: Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead. Emily keeps staring at him.
C: EMILY
D: Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
C: KANE
D: I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right. He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
N: Emily nods several times. There is an uncomforable silence. Suddenly there is a cry from the crib. Emily leaps from the bed and rushes to him. She bends over the crib.
C: EMILY
D: Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
E: murmuring
C: KANE
D: Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
C: EMILY
D: They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you!
N: Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on. Tightening his lips, he walks out.

S: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual intensity, Reilly standing beside him at the desk.
C: KANE
D: We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
C: REILLY
D: Mr. Leland sent back that check.
C: KANE
D: What check?
C: REILLY
D: You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
C: KANE
D: Oh, yes, the bonus.
C: REILLY
D: It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
N: Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else.
C: REILLY
D: He sent it back torn up - all torn up into little bits, and he enclosed something else - I can't make it out.
N: Kane doesn't answer. Reilly goes on. He has brought out a piece of paper and is reading it.
C: REILLY
D: It says here, "A Declaration of Principles" - "I will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly" -
E: he still reads
N: Kane has looked up sharply. Reilly, sensing his look, stops reading and meets his eye. Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand. Reilly hands him the piece of paper. Without reading it, Kane tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -
N: The evening of the final great rally. These shots remind us of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" scenes earlier. The vast auditorium with a huge picture of Kane, cheering crowds, etc. Emily and Junior are to be seen in the front of a box. Emily is tired and wears a forced smile on her face. Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright- eyed and excited. Kane is just finishing his speech.
C: KANE
D: It is no secret that I entered upon this campaign with no thought that I could be elected Governor of this state! It is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that I will be elected. And I repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward G. Rogers!
N: Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.
T: DISSOLVE OUT:
S: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -
N: The Speaker's Platform. Numerous officials and civic leaders are crowding around Kane. Cameramen take flash photographs with old-fashioined flash powder.
C: FIRST CIVIC LEADER
D: Great speech, Mr. Kane.
C: SECOND LEADER
D: One of the most notable public utterances ever made by a candidate in this state -
E: pompous
C: KANE
D: Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
N: He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the boy were sitting is now empty. He starts toward the rear of the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches him.
C: REILLY
D: A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.
N: Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along.
C: REILLY
D: I just got word from Buffalo, Mr. Kane. They're going to throw you the organization vote - and take a chance maybe you'll give them a break -
N: This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making a mistake. There is no answer from Kane.
C: REILLY
D: On an independent ticket there's never been anything like it! If the election were held today, you'd be elected by a hundred thousand votes - and every day between now and November 7th is just going to add to your majority.
N: Kane is very pleased. He continues with Reilly slowly through the crowd - a band playing off. Bernstein joins him.
C: KANE
D: It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
C: REILLY
D: Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
C: KANE
D: I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
E: stopping
C: BERNSTEIN
D: It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
E: clearly not meaning it
C: KANE
D: You don't really think so?
C: BERNSTEIN
D: I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
E: interrupts himself
C: KANE
D: Please, Mr. Bernstein.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
E: comes out with it
N: Kane indicates he is to proceed.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Well, you're running for Governor and going to be elected - my idea is how wonderful it would be if you don't run at all and don't get elected.

S: EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -
N: Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane.
C: JUNIOR
D: Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?
N: Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men. Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet Emily.
C: KANE
D: Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech?
C: JUNIOR
D: Hello, Pop! I was in a box. I could hear every word.
C: KANE
D: I saw you! Good night, gentlemen.
E: he has his arm around Junior's shoulder
N: There are good nights. Kane's car is at the curb and he starts to walk toward it with Junior and Emily.
C: EMILY
D: I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
C: KANE
D: But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
C: EMILY
D: There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
C: KANE
D: It can wait.
C: EMILY
D: No, it can't. Good night, darling.
E: she bends down and kisses Junior
C: JUNIOR
D: Good night, Mom.

C: KANE
D: What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
E: as car starts to drive off
C: EMILY
D: It may not be about anything at all.
N: A cab has pulled up.
C: THE DRIVER
D: Cab?
N: Emily nods to him.
C: EMILY
D: I intend to find out.
C: KANE
D: I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
C: EMILY
D: I'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street.
E: she looks at a slip of paper in her hand
N: Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means something to him.
C: EMILY

N: Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door. Emily is pressing the bell.
C: KANE
D: I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy.
N: Emily does not answer. The door is opened by a maid, who recognizes Kane.
C: THE MAID
D: Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.
N: They enter, Emily first.
S: INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -
N: There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open door shows the living room. Kane and Emily enter from the hallway and cross to the living room. As they enter, Susan rises from a chair. The other person in the room - a big, heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently.
C: SUSAN
D: It wasn't my fault, Charlie. He made me send your wife a note. He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do... I -
E: she catches sight of Emily
C: ROGERS
D: Good evening, Mr. Kane. I don't suppose anybody would introduce us. Mrs. Kane, I am Edward Rogers.
E: he rises
C: EMILY
D: How do you do? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... because I recieved this note -
E: pauses she consults the note in her hand without reading it again
C: ROGERS
D: I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note. She was a little unwilling at first - but she did it.
E: he smiles grimly
C: SUSAN
D: I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -
C: KANE
D: Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.
E: turning on Rogers he starts toward him
C: ROGERS
D: Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
E: not giving way an inch
C: EMILY
D: Charles! Your - your breaking this man's neck - would scarcely explain this note - Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - for myself, and for my son. What does this note mean, Miss -
E: he stops to look at her she is clearly disgusted glancing at the note slowly
C: SUSAN
D: I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you think, Mrs. Kane, but -
E: stiffly pauses
C: EMILY
D: What does this note mean, Miss Alexander?
E: ignoring this
C: ROGERS
D: She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane. She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
C: KANE
D: In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
E: he puts a world of scorn into the word
C: ROGERS
D: I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one. I don't even know what a gentleman is. You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had. Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother. It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
E: tensely, with all the hatred and venom in the world he has to control himself from hurling himself at Kane
C: EMILY
D: Oh!!
C: KANE
D: You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
C: ROGERS
D: Anything you say, Mr. Kane. Only we're talking now about what you are. That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane. Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. I'm fighting for my life. Not just my political life. My life. If your husband is elected governor -
C: KANE
D: I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
C: EMILY
D: Let him finish, Charles.
C: ROGERS
D: I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane. This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected. I don't care whether they know what I know about him. Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral - Champeen of the people. Just as long as -
E: he stresses the world
C: EMILY
D: I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but wonder if -
E: she leaves her sentence unfinished
C: KANE
D: You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
C: SUSAN
D: Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
E: excitedly
C: ROGERS
D: That's the chance I'm willing to give you, Mr. Kane. More of a chance than you'd give me. Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you're so sick that you've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story I'm going to give them.
N: Kane starts to stare at him intently.
C: EMILY
D: What story, Mr. Rogers?
C: ROGERS
D: The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
N: Emily looks at Kane.
C: SUSAN
D: There is no story. It's all lies. Mr. Kane is just -
C: ROGERS
D: Shut up! I've had a dozen men doing nothing but run this thing down - we've got evidence enough to - well, the evidence would stand up in any court of law. You want me to give you the evidence, Mr. Kane?
E: to Susan to Kane
C: KANE
D: You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
C: ROGERS
D: Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me. I'd like to show you -
C: EMILY
D: You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you.
C: ROGERS
D: I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him. But I'd be better off that way - - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
E: he pauses
C: SUSAN
D: What about me? He said my name'd be dragged through the mud. He said everywhere I'd go from now on -
E: to Kane
C: EMILY
D: There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles. I'd say that it has been made for you. I suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers. About the statements by the doctors -
E: pauses
C: KANE
D: Have you gone completely mad, Emily?
N: Emily looks at him.
C: KANE
D: You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
C: EMILY
D: I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
C: KANE
D: Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
C: EMILY
D: Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
E: quickly
C: KANE
D: I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
E: squirming a bit
C: EMILY
D: I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now. I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
C: SUSAN
D: Charlie! If they publish this story -
C: EMILY
D: They won't. Goodnight, Mr. Rogers. There's nothing more to be said, Charles.
E: she starts out
C: KANE
D: Oh yes, there is.
C: EMILY
D: I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
C: KANE
D: No.
N: She looks at him. He starts to work himself into a rage.
C: KANE
D: There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
C: EMILY
D: You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
E: she looks at Susan she sighs
C: KANE
D: Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
C: ROGERS
D: You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. You're licked. Why don't you -
C: KANE
D: Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
E: turning on him
C: ROGERS
D: I see!
E: he starts toward the door
C: SUSAN
D: Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
E: starting to cry
C: KANE
D: I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
E: he is screaming
C: EMILY
D: Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
E: quietly
C: KANE
D: Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!
E: he can't find the adjective
C: SUSAN
D: Charlie, there are other things to think of. Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers -
E: a sly look comes into her eyes
C: EMILY
D: It is too late now, Charles.
C: KANE
D: Get out, both of you!
E: rushes to the door and opens it
C: SUSAN
D: Charlie, please don't -
E: rushes to him
C: KANE
D: What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
C: EMILY
D: Goodnight, Charles.
N: She walks out. Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of Kane.
C: ROGERS
D: You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.
E: he walks past Kane
C: KANE
D: Don't you worry about me. I'm Charles Foster Kane. I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -

D: Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
N: She doesn't have anything to say.

D: I'm glad to see you.
N: She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in the world for her to smile at. She's too grateful to talk.
C: EMILY
D: Are all the returns in?
N: Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.
C: EMILY
D: Let me see it.
N: Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. She takes it. We see the headline, not an insert, but it registers. It reads: "Fraud at Polls." Emily is looking at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.
C: LELAND
D: Almost two to one -
E: after a pause
C: EMILY
D: I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
C: LELAND
D: Emily!
C: EMILY
D: Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
C: LELAND
D: Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
C: EMILY
D: There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
C: LELAND

E: he thinks

S: INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" -
N: The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage. We see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is Susan. She is almost hysterical with fright. Maids, singing teacher, and the rest are in attendance. Her throat is sprayed. Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the orchestra starts thunderously. The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face. She squints and starts to sing. Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly. The camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops. Two typical stage hands fill the frame. They are looking down on the stage below. Some of the reflected light gleams on their faces. They look at each other. One of them puts his hand to his nose.

S: INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -
N: Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys. The paper is gone from the roller. Leland stirs and looks up drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside him (also as in the previous scene).
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Hello, Mr. Leland.
C: LELAND
D: Hello, Bernstein.
N: Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together. He straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is gone from the machine.
C: LELAND
D: Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Mr. Kane is finishing it.
E: quietly
C: LELAND
D: Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
E: painfully, he rises to his feet
N: During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - a busy typewriter. Leland's eyes follow the sound. Slowly he registers Kane in the City Room beyond. This is almost the same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.
S: INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -
N: Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile. Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at him.
C: LELAND
D: I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
E: moving to his side
N: Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein.
C: BERNSTEIN
D: He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - - I guess that'll show you.
E: then suddnely - with a kind of quiet passion rather than a triumph
N: Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side. Kane goes on typing, without looking up. After a pause, Kane speaks.
C: KANE
D: Hello, Brad.
C: LELAND
D: Hello, Charlie -
N: (ANOTHER PAUSE) I didn't know we were speaking. Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn.

D: Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. Hey, nurse! Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know. Shangri-la? El Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name of that place? You know... All right. Xanadu. I knew what it was all the time. You caught on, didn't you?
E: pause as if trying to think pauses
C: THOMPSON
D: Yes.
C: LELAND
D: I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her -
C: THOMPSON
D: That must have been love.
C: LELAND
D: I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
E: calls lowers his voice
C: THOMPSON
D: Sure.
C: LELAND
D: On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
C: THOMPSON
D: Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.
C: LELAND
D: Hey, Nurse!
N: A Nurse appears.
C: NURSE
D: Hello, Mr. Leland.
C: LELAND
D: I'm ready to go in now. You know when I was a young man, there was an impression around that nurses were pretty. It was no truer then than it is now.
C: NURSE
D: Here, let me take your arm, Mr. Leland.
C: LELAND
D: All right, all right. You won't forget, will you, about the cigars? And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk. That young doctor I was telling you about, he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.

D: I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.

T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
S: EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK -
N: NIGHT - Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period, is leaving the drug store. It's about 8 o'clock at night. With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her cheek, she is in considerable pain. The street is wet - after a recent rain. She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer. She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums. She walks on, the pain only a bit better. Four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - a shabby, old four-story apartment house. She turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps. As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her. His shoulder bumps hers and she turns. As she does so, Kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk. The plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.
C: KANE
D: Ow!
E: hopping up and down and rubbing his knee
N: Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with laughter.
C: KANE
D: It's not funny.
N: He bites his lip and rubs his knee again. Susan tries to control her laughter, but not very successfully. Kane glares at her.
C: SUSAN
D: I'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny.
N: Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw.
C: SUSAN
D: Ow!
C: KANE
D: What's the matter with you?
C: SUSAN
D: Toothache.
C: KANE
D: Hmm!
N: He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief.
C: SUSAN
D: You've got some on your face.
C: KANE
D: If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
N: Susan starts to laugh again.
C: KANE
D: What's funny now?
C: SUSAN
D: You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
N: In the middle of her smile, the pain returns.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh!
C: KANE
D: You're no Venus de Milo.
C: SUSAN
D: If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
E: points to the downstair window
C: KANE
D: Thanks.
N: Susan starts, with Kane following her.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -
N: It's in moderate disorder. The Mansbach gas lights are on. It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast. There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few personal belongings on the chiffonier. These include a photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and a few objets d'art. One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in his hand in the first sequence. Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over her arm. Kane is waiting for her. She doesn't close the door.
C: SUSAN
D: My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller. She's a very decent woman. Ow!
E: by way of explanation starts to put the basin down making a face
N: Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the chiffonier. To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one side of the basin. Susan grabs the photograph as it is about to fall over.
C: SUSAN
D: Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
C: KANE
D: I'm sorry. They live here, too?
C: SUSAN
D: No. They've passed on.
N: Again she puts her hand to her jaw.
C: KANE
D: Where's the soap?
C: SUSAN
D: In the water.
N: Kane fishes the soap out of the water. It is slippery, however, and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it falls to the floor. Susan laughs as he bends over.
C: KANE
D: You're very easily amused.
E: starting to wash his hands
C: SUSAN
D: I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
N: Her face distorts in pain again.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh!
C: KANE
D: I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
C: SUSAN
D: I know... But you do look so silly.
E: laughs
N: Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.
C: KANE
D: Where's the towel?
C: SUSAN
D: On the chiffonier. Here.
C: KANE
D: Thanks.
E: rubs his face dry
C: SUSAN
D: I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
E: on her way to closet
C: KANE
D: I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
N: Susan comes out of the closet. She holds out the brush with her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.
C: KANE
D: You are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid?
E: takes the brush
N: Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent over, whimpering a bit.
C: KANE
D: Wish there was something I could -
E: brushing himself
N: He stops and thinks. Susan, her face averted, is still trying hard not to cry.
C: KANE
D: I've got an idea, young lady. Turn around and look at me. I said, turn around and look at me, young lady.
E: there is no response there is still no response
N: Slowly, Susan turns.
C: KANE
D: Did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time?
N: It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this.
C: KANE
D: Watch closely! It took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick. The fellow who taught me is President of Venezuela now.
E: he wiggles his ears
N: He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile.
C: KANE
D: That's it! Smile!
N: Susan smiles, very broadly.

C: KANE
D: You really don't know who I am?
E: looks squarely at her
C: SUSAN
D: No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -

D: You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
E: she stops
C: KANE
D: And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
E: he smiles
C: SUSAN
D: I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
C: KANE
D: I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
E: as if defending himself from a terrible onslaught pauses
N: Susan is bewildered.
C: KANE
D: You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago. Her things were put into storage out west because I had no place to put them then. I still haven't. But now I've sent for them just the same. And tonight I'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood, I suppose - to look again at - and now -
E: slowly he changes mood slightly
N: Kane doesn't finish. He looks at Susan. Silence.
C: KANE
D: Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?

C: SUSAN
D: Oh, me -
C: KANE
D: How old did you say you were?
C: SUSAN
D: I didn't say.
E: very bright
C: KANE
D: I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
C: SUSAN
D: Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
C: KANE
D: That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
E: looks at her silently for a moment
C: SUSAN
D: I work at Seligman's.
C: KANE
D: Is that what you want to do?
C: SUSAN
D: I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
E: she thinks for a moment
C: KANE
D: What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
E: sympathetically
C: SUSAN
D: Oh, no! Nothing like that. Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
N: A sudden look comes over Kane's face.
C: KANE
D: Yes -
C: SUSAN
D: As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
C: KANE
D: Would you sing for me?
E: points to the piano
C: SUSAN
D: Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
E: bashful
C: KANE
D: Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
C: SUSAN
D: Well, I -
C: KANE
D: Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
C: SUSAN
D: Oh, no, that's all gone.
C: KANE
D: Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
N: Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and sings a polite song. Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, untrained voice. Kane listens. He is relaxed, at ease with the world.

D: What about that apartment?

D: He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother? You don't believe me, but it's true. It just happens to be true. He was really interested in my voice. What are you smiling for? What do you think he built that opera house for? I didn't want it. I didn't want to sing. It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.

N: Susan is singing. Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the piano. Kane is seated nearby. Matisti stops.
C: MATISTI
D: Impossible! Impossible!
C: KANE
D: Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
C: MATISTI
D: But, it is impossible. I will be the laughingstock of the musical world! People will say -
E: sweating
C: KANE
D: If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren't you, maestro?
E: he looks him square in the eyes
C: MATISTI
D: Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
C: KANE
D: You can't.

S: INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT -
N: It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the audience. The curtain is down. We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands. As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly alone. The curtain rises. The glare of the footlights jump into the image. The curtain is now out of the picture and Susan starts to sing. Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter. Beyond that, out in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer. Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness. Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening. Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of thing that often happens in a theatre -
C: THE VOICE
D: - really pathetic.
N: Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume. Closeup of Susan's face - singing. Closeup of Kane's face - listening. There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding as little as possible. Kane still looks. Then, near the camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding very, very loudly. Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their palms together. The curtain is falling - as we can see by the light which shutters down off their faces. The stage from Kane's angle. The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it. Still, the polite applause dying fast. Nobody comes out for a bow. Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily. Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously. The stage from the audience again. Susan appears for her bow. She can hardly walk. There is a little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly. Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes on Susan. The stage again. Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains. The light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on. Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.

S: INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY -
N: Some weeks later. Susan, in a negligee, is at the window. There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table.
C: SUSAN
D: You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous? What about me? I'm the one that has to do the singing. I'm the one that gets the razzberries. Last week, when I was shopping, one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl. She thought I didn't see her, but - Charlie, you might as well make up your mind to it. This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. I can't sing and you know it - Why can't you just -
E: pauses
N: Kane rises and walks toward her. There is cold menace in his walk. Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her.
C: KANE
D: My reasons satisfy me, Susan. You seem unable to understand them. I will not tell them to you again. You will continue with your singing.
E: he is very close to her
N: His eyes are relentlessly upon her. She sees something in them that frightens her. She nods her head slowly, indicating surrender.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN:
N: Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large portrait of Susan as Thais (as before). It is announced that Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in "Thais." The picture remains constant but the names of the papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers." During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking a little. At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound of this, one man loudly applauding. This fades out as we -

C: DR. COREY
D: She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.
N: Kane nods. He has a small bottle in his hand.
C: DR. COREY
D: The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.
C: KANE
D: Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
C: DR. COREY
D: I'm sure that's it.
E: he starts out
C: KANE
D: There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
C: DR. COREY
D: Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you. They just -

C: SUSAN
D: I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
C: KANE
D: As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want.
C: SUSAN

C: KANE
D: Susan, I really think -
C: SUSAN
D: Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
C: KANE
D: Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
E: he has risen
C: SUSAN
D: Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. Tried to bribe them!

S: INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -
N: Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste. Off of occasional tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of bric-a-brac. Raymond stands in the doorway watching him. Kane says nothing. He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits. The curtains (too frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room. Finally he stops. Susie's cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him. He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice. Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with the snowstorm in it. He yanks it down. Something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball. It bounces on the carpet and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry. His eye follows it. He stoops to pick it up - can't make it. Raymond picks it up for him; hands it to him. Kane takes it sheepishly - looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

D: Raymond -
E: he is almost in a trance
C: RAYMOND
D: Yes, sir -
N: One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up. Kane shakes the ball again. Another flurry of snow. He watches the flakes settle - then looks up. Finally, taking in the pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the glass ball in his coat pocket. He speaks very quietly to Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.
C: KANE
D: Keep it locked.
N: He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way to let him pass, and watching him as he goes. He is an old, old man!

A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt. Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on. The men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor. The men now place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words: CHARLES FOSTER KANE II. 1907 - 1938

C: KANE
D: Do you like poetry, Raymond?
C: RAYMOND

N: A short pause. His eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, Kane quotes the translation.
C: KANE
D: The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not. I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth." But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne. O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step. He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it. Where are the men with towering hopes? They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace.

D: See what I mean? He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything. I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor. He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out. But I knew how to take care of him.
E: rises
N: Thompson doesn't answer.
C: RAYMOND
D: You can go on asking questions if you want to.
C: THOMPSON
D: We're leaving tonight. As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
E: coldly
N: Thompson has risen. Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the door, opening it for him.
C: RAYMOND
D: Allow yourself plenty of time. The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait. Not now. I can remember when they'd wait all day ... if Mr. Kane said so.
N: Raymond ushes Thompson into
S: INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -
N: The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and small, are piled pell mell all over the place. Furniture, statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same story. Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, rustling the papers. In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant are busy photographing the sundry objects. The floor is littered with burnt-out flash bulbs. They continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a flash bulb goes off. In addition to the Photographer and his Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and Raymond. The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph. A flash bulb goes off. The Photographer has just photographed a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive. The Assistant consults a label on the back of it.
C: ASSISTANT
D: NO. 9182
N: The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down.
C: ASSISTANT
D: "Nativity" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira. Got that?
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Yeah.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: All right! Next! Better get that statue over there.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Okay.
N: The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the hall.
C: RAYMOND
D: What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
C: THOMPSON
D: Millions - if anybody wants it.
C: RAYMOND
D: The banks are out of luck, eh?
C: THOMPSON
D: Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.
C: ASSISTANT
D: "Venus," Fourth Century. Acquired 1911. Cost twenty-three thousand. Got it?
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Okay.
C: ASSISTANT
D: That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
E: patting the statue on the fanny
C: SECOND ASSISTANT
D: No. 483. One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado. Value $6.00.
E: reading a label
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Okay.
N: A flashlight bulb goes off.
C: SECOND ASSISTANT
D: We're all set to get everything. The junk as well as the art.
N: Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful of little pieces of cardboard.
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: What's that?
C: RAYMOND
D: It's a jigsaw puzzle.
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: We got a lot of those. There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.
N: Raymond laughs.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Yeah, all in crates.
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
C: ASSISTANT
D: Iron stove. Estate of Mary Kane. Value $2.00.
E: reading a label
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Put it over by that statue. It'll make a good setup.
C: GIRL
D: Who is she anyway?
E: calling out
C: SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Venus. She always is.
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: He sure liked to collect things, didn't he?
C: RAYMOND
D: He went right on buying - right up to the end.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: wonder - You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
N: Thompson has turned around. He is facing the camera for the first time.
C: THOMPSON
D: Charles Foster Kane.
N: Another flash bulb goes off. The Photographer turns to Thompson with a grin.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Or Rosebud? How about it, Jerry?
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
E: to the dancers
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
E: to the Third Newspaperman
C: THOMPSON
D: No, I didn't.
N: The music has stopped. The dancers have come over to Thompson.
C: SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry?
C: THOMPSON
D: Not much.
C: SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Well, what have you been doing?
C: THOMPSON
D: Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - I talked to a lot of people who knew him.
C: GIRL
D: What do they say?
C: THOMPSON
D: Well - it's become a very clear picture. He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide. He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto. But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was. He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it. He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with. Outside of that -
C: THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
D: Okay, okay.
C: GIRL
D: What about Rosebud? Don't you think that explains anything?
C: THOMPSON
D: No, I don't. Not much anway. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.
N: He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch.
C: THOMPSON
D: We'd better get along. We'll miss the train.
N: He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher with at the opening of the picture. Camera doesn't close in on this. It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great hall.
T: DISSOLVE:
S: INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -
N: A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene. Two laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace. Raymond is about ten feet away.
C: RAYMOND
D: Throw that junk in, too.
N: Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated. It is mostly bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc. The sled is on top of the pile. As camera comes close, it shows the faded rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the word "ROSEBUD" across it. The laborer drops his shovel, takes the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace. The flames start to devour it.
S: EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -
N: No lights are to be seen. Smoke is coming from a chimney. Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages. It moves finally through the gates, which close behind it. As camera pauses for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight. Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing. On the fence is a sign which reads: "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
