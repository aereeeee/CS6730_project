M: SEQUENCE "A"
N: A-l-4 START the picture with the actual street sign: SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope. In the gutter lie dead leaves, scraps of paper, burnt matches and cigarette butts. It is early morning. Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the grey asphalt of the street filling the screen. As speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de- marcations, white arrows, speed-limit warnings, man- hole covers, etc., flash by. SUPERIMPOSED on all this are the CREDIT TITLES, in the stencilled style of the street sign. Over the scene we now hear MAN'S VOICE sirens.

There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp. Also a small desk littered with books and letters, and a chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some records on top. On the walls are a couple of repro- ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry bills and snapshots stuck in the frames. Through an archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange peels, etc. The effect is dingy and cheerless -- just another furnished apartment. The buzzer SOUNDS.
C: GILLIS
D: Yeah.
N: The buzzer SOUNDS again. Gillis gets up and opens the door. Two men wearing hats stand outside one of them carrying a briefcase. NO. 1 Joseph C. Gillis?

T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A-11 SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE It is in the style of a Paramount executive's office -- mahogany, leather, and a little chintz. On the walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake. Also a couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an Oscar on a bookshelf. A shooting schedule chart is thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board. There are piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the background, some set models. Start on Sheldrake. He is about 45. Behind his wor- ried face there hides a coated tongue. He is en- gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in his Zeus holder.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: All right, Gillis. You've got five minutes. What's your story about?
C: GILLIS
D: It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up. But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
C: GILLIS
D: More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
N: A secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk. She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for Sheldrake.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Got a title?
C: GILLIS
D: Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
E: To the secretary
N: The secretary exits. Sheldrake takes a pill and washes it down with some milk.
C: GILLIS
D: They're pretty hot about it over at Twentieth, but I think Zanuck's all wet. Can you see Ty Power as a
N: GILLIS (cont'd) shortstop? You've got the best man for it right here on this lot. Alan Ladd. Good change of pace for Alan Ladd. There's another thing: it's pretty simple to shoot. Lot of outdoor stuff. Bet you could make the whole thing for under a million. And there's a great little part for Bill Demarest. One of the trainers, an oldtime player who got beaned and goes out of his head sometimes. The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean- cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert manner. Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and pearls, and carrying a folder of papers. She puts them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who stands near the door.
C: BETTY
D: Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.
E: She holds it out
C: SHELDRAKE
D: What's wrong with it?
C: BETTY
D: It's from hunger.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Nothing for Ladd?
C: BETTY
D: Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
N: Betty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: This is Miss Kramer.
C: BETTY
D: Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
C: GILLIS
D: If I could be of any help...
C: BETTY
D: I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
C: GILLIS
D: Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Name dropper.
C: BETTY
D: I just think pictures should say a little something.
C: GILLIS
D: Oh, you're one of the message kids. Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
C: BETTY
D: Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
C: GILLIS
D: That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.
C: BETTY
D: So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics. Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
C: BETTY
D: Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
C: GILLIS
D: Goodbye. Next time I'll write The Naked and the Dead.
N: Betty leaves.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
C: GILLIS
D: Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
E: His mind free-wheeling
C: GILLIS
D: Frankly, no.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers. Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
E: Amusing himself
C: GILLIS
D: You trying to be funny? -- because I'm all out of laughs. I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Sure, Gillis. If something should come along -
C: GILLIS
D: Along is no good. I need it now.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Haven't got a thing.
C: GILLIS
D: Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
C: SHELDRAKE
D: There's nothing, Gillis. Not even if you were a relative.
C: GILLIS
D: Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
E: Hating it
C: SHELDRAKE
D: Could I? Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had been elected -

Was he out digging up a job for poor Joe Gillis? Hmph! He was hard at work in Bel Air, making with the golf clubs. Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He walks toward the exit. He is stopped by the voice of

C: GILLIS
D: Sure. Just sold an original for a hundred grand. The Life of the Warner Brothers. Starring the Ritz Brothers. Playing opposite the Andrew Sisters.

C: GILLIS
D: No?
C: MORINO
D: Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
N: He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee, Gillis following him.
C: GILLIS
D: How's that about your being my friend?
C: MORINO
D: Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
C: GILLIS
D: Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.

He turns and sees A-3O THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE Max von Mayerling stands there. He is sixty, and all in black, except for immaculate white cotton gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow tie. His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers ledger-atriped. He is semi-paralyzed. The left side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a rubber-ferruled stick.

S: A-31 INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL
N: It is grandiose and grim. The whole place is one of those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and beams imported from Italy, with California termites at work on them. Portieres are drawn before all the windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always burning. Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble staircase. It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn velvet rope along the wall.
C: MAX
D: If you need help with the coffin call me.
E: From below
N: The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis' imagination. He climbs the stairs with a kind of morbid fascination. At the top he stops, undecided, then turns to the right and is stopped by
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: This way!
N: Gillis swings around. Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a doorway from which emerges a flickering light. She is a little woman. There is a curious style, a great sense of high voltage about her. She is dress- ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled pumps. Around her throat there is a leopard-pat- terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of the same material. Her skin is very pale, and she is wearing dark glasses.
C: NORMA
D: In here. I put him on my massage table in front of the fire. He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick.
N: Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into A-32 NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly torn in a few places. There's a great, unmade gilded bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had begun to peel. There is a disorder of clothes and negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars about. In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn- ing. On the massage table before it lies a small form shrouded under a Spanish shawl. At each end on a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande- labrum, the candles lighted.
C: NORMA
D: I've made up my mind we'll bury him in the garden. Any city laws against that?
C: GILLIS
D: I wouldn't know.
C: NORMA
D: I don't care anyway. I want the coffin to be white. And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
N: She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the color. From under the shawl flops down a dead arm. Gillis stares and recoils a little. It is like a child's arm, only black and hairy.
C: NORMA
D: Maybe red. bright flaming red. Gay. Let's make it gay.
N: Gillis edges closer and glances down. Under the shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead chimpanzee. Norma drops back the shawl.
C: NORMA
D: How much will it be? I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
C: GILLIS
D: Lady. you've got the wrong man.
N: For the first time. Norma really looks at him through her dark glasses.
C: GILLIS
D: I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire. I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
C: NORMA
D: It is not. Get out.
C: GILLIS
D: I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
C: NORMA
D: Get out.
C: GILLIS
D: Sure. Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
C: NORMA
D: Or shall I call my servant?
C: GILLIS
D: I know your face. You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.
C: NORMA
D: I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
C: GILLIS
D: I knew there was something wrong with them.
C: NORMA
D: They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
C: GILLIS
D: That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
C: NORMA
D: Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
C: GILLIS
D: Don't get sore at me. I'm not an executive. I'm just a writer.

D: Get out!
N: Gillis starts down the stairs.
C: GILLIS
D: Next time I'll bring my autograph album along, or maybe a hunk of cement and ask for your footprints.
N: He is halfway down the staircase when he is stopped by
C: NORMA
D: Just a minute, you!
C: GILLIS
D: Yeah?
C: NORMA
D: You're a writer, you said.
C: GILLIS
D: Why?
N: Norma starts down the stairs.
C: NORMA
D: Are you or aren't you?
C: GILLIS
D: I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
C: NORMA
D: And you have written pictures, haven't you?
C: GILLIS
D: Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
N: Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.
C: NORMA
D: I want to ask you something. Come in here.
N: She leads him into A-33 THE HUGE LIVING ROOM It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props from the Mark of Zorro set. Along the main wall, a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years. On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of Norma Desmond in her various roles. On one wall is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene, Carthay Circle school. (We will learn later that it hides a motion picture screen.) One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly moaning sound. Gillis looks around.
C: NORMA
D: The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I ought to have it taken out.
C: GILLIS
D: Or teach it a better tune.
N: Norma has led him to the card tables which stand side by side near a window. They are piled high with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.
C: NORMA
D: How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
C: GILLIS
D: Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
C: NORMA
D: This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.
C: GILLIS
D: Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
E: Looking at the piles of script
C: NORMA
D: It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
C: GILLIS
D: Uh-huh.
C: NORMA

D: I'd better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
C: GILLIS
D: No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
C: MAX
D: I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
N: Max leaves. Gillis comes out of the bathroom, picks up his shirts, goes over to a closet, opens it. As he does so one of the doors without a lock swings slightly open. Gillis looks through the half-open door and sees. C-4 NORMA DESMOND'S ROOM It is empty. The rainy GILLIS' VOICE day does nothing to There it was again - that help its gloom. room of hers, all satin and ruffles, and that bed like a gilded rowboat. The per- fect setting for a silent movie queen. Poor devil, still waving proudly to a parade which had long since passed her by. He pushes the door shut and walks back into the room.

N: Gillis is coming down the GILLIS' VOICE stairs in his tailcoat It was at her New Year's adjusting the handkerchief party that I found out in his pocket. He obviously how she felt about me. feels a little uneasy in Maybe I'd been an idiot this outfit. From below not to have sensed it comes a tango of the Twen- was coming - that sad, ties. played by a small embarrassing revelation. orchestra. Gillis stops in the archway leading to the big room and looks around. C-6 THE BIG ROOM has been deco- rated for the occasion with laurel garlands. Dozens of candles in all the sconces and candelabra are ablaze. Their flickering flames are reflected in the waxed sur= face of the tile floor. There is a buffet, with buckets of champagne and caviar on ice. In one corner on a little platform banked with palms. a four-piece orchestra is playing. At the buffet are Max and Norma. She is drinking a glass of champagne. She is wearing a diamonte evening dress. very high style. with long black gloves and a headdress of paradise feathers. Her eyes fall on Gillis. She puts down the glass of champagne. picks up a gardenia boutonniere and moves toward him.
C: NORMA
D: Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!
C: GILLIS
D: (Embarrassed} Please.
C: NORMA
D: Come on!
N: Gillis makes a slow 36O-degree turn.
C: NORMA
D: Perfect. Wonderful shoulders. And I love that line.
N: She indicates the V from his shoulders to his hips.
C: GILLIS
D: All padding. Don't let it fool you.
C: NORMA
D: Come here!
N: She puts the gardenia on his lapel.
C: GILLIS
D: You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
C: NORMA
D: I don't like those studs they've sent. I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
C: GILLIS
D: Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
C: NORMA
D: Cute. Let's have some drinks.
N: She leads him over to the buffet.
C: GILLIS
D: Shouldn't we wait for the others?
C: NORMA
D: Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
E: Pointing at the floor
N: They reach the buffet. Max is ready with two glasses of champagne. Norma hands Gillis a glass.
C: NORMA
D: Here's to us.
N: They drink.
C: NORMA
D: You know, this floor used to be wood but I had it changed. Valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a tango.
N: She opens her arms.
C: GILLIS
D: Not on the same floor with Valentino!
C: NORMA
D: Just follow me.
N: They start to tango. After a moment --
C: NORMA
D: Don't bend back like that.
C: GILLIS
D: It's those feathers. They tickle.
N: Norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair and tosses them away. C-7 THE ORCHESTRA As they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc- ing couple, take in the situation, exchange glances and turn away with professional discretion. C-8 NORMA AND GILLIS, TANGOING Gillis glances at his wrist watch.
C: GILLIS
D: It's a quarter past ten. What time are they supposed to get here?
C: NORMA
D: Who?
C: GILLIS
D: The other guests?
C: NORMA
D: There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
C: GILLIS
D: I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.
C: NORMA
D: Hold me tighter.
C: GILLIS
D: Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
C: NORMA
D: You think this is all very funny.
C: GILLIS
D: A little.
C: NORMA
D: Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
C: GILLIS
D: What's that?
C: NORMA
D: I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
N: They dance on. Gillis is acutely embarrassed. THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe- mphasized lack of interest. Finally it winds up on Max, behind the buffet. He stands watching Gillis, a faint trace of pity in his eyes.

N: C-9 NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE CIGARETTE GADGET, as she GILLIS' VOICE inserts a cigarette. I'm sure a lot of you will laugh about this. Ridicu- lous situation, wasn't it? -- a woman almost twice my age ... It got to be about a quarter of eleven. I felt caught, like a cig- arette in the prongs of that contraption on her finger. PULL BACK TO: NORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the cavernous fireplace. Norma holds out her cigarette to Gillis, who lights it.
C: NORMA.
D: What a wonderful next year it's going to be. What fun we're going to have. I'II fill the pool for you. Or I'll open my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean. Or I'll buy you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii.
C: GILLIS
D: Stop it. You aren't going to buy me anything more.
C: NORMA
D: Don't be silly. Here. I was going to give it to you at midniglht.
E: She reaches under a pillow of the couch and brings out a leather box
N: Gillis opens the box. It contains a matched gold cigarette case and lighter.
C: NORMA
D: Read what's inside.
N: Gillis snaps open the case. Engraved inside the cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of music.
C: GILLIS
D: What are the notes?
C: NORMA
D: "Mad about the boy."
C: GILLIS
D: Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.
C: NORMA
D: Shut up. I'm rich. I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
C: GILLIS
D: Keep it.
C: NORMA
D: I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.

D: What's the matter with you?
C: GILLIS
D: What right do you have to take me for granted?
C: NORMA
D: What right? Do you want me to tell you?
C: GILLIS
D: Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
C: NORMA
D: Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
C: GILLIS
D: Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
C: NORMA
D: What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
E: Getting up slowly
N: Gillis doesn't answer. Norma slaps his face and rushes from the room and upstairs. Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek. C-1O THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor and into her bedroom, banging the door. MOVE THE CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the gouged-out lock. C-11 GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM He still stands motionless. He glances around fur- tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed. C-12 THE ORCHESTRA The musicians are playing away. They have turned their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious- ly for comfort. C-13 GILLIS His eyes move over toward C-14 MAX He is subtler than the musicians. He appears very busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used glasses on a tray. He walks across the room with them. C-15 GILLIS He starts slowly out. As he does so his long gold key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa and holds him for a second of additional embarrass- ment. He yanks it loose and walks with as much nonchalance as he can muster to C-16 THE HALL Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a look upstairs. Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the entrance door. He opens the door on the darkness of the courtyard.

N: (NIGHT - RAIN) Gillis shuts the door. GILLIS'VOICE He takes a few steps I didn't know where I was forward, then stands going. I just had to get for a while breathing out of there.

Gillis walks to the street, which is dark and empty. He starts down Sunset in an Easterly direction. A car passes. He tries to thumb a ride, without success. However, the second car, a florist's delivery wagon, stops. Gillis jumps in and the car drives off.

N: C-19 ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed with young people flowing over into the miniature bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette. The only drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time. Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests party dress. Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano and sings Tokio Rose. By the door, a group of young men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar, in the manner of a Bach choral. Artie Green, a dark haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties, is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl. The door behind some of the singers is pushed open, jostling them out of their places. In comes Gillis, his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat turned up. Artie stops conducting, but the commer- cial goes right on.
C: ARTIE
D: Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
C: GILLIS
D: Hi, Artie.
C: ARTIE
D: Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
C: GILLIS
D: In a deep freeze.
C: ARTIE
D: I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
E: To the company
N: Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and Artie push their way into the room.
C: ARTIE
D: Give me your coat.
C: GILLIS
D: Let it ride for a while.
C: ARTIE
D: You're going to stay, aren't you?
C: GILLIS
D: That was the general idea.
C: ARTIE
D: Come on.
N: Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis. Its texture takes his breath away.
C: ARTIE
D: What is this - mink?
N: He has taken the coat. He looks at Gillis standing there in tails.
C: ARTIE
D: Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
C: GILLIS
D: Close, but no cigar.
N: Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book- shelf.
C: ARTIE
D: Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days, are you?
C: GILLIS
D: Where's the bar?
N: The two make their way toward the punch bowl. It's a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis. There are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails. When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a half-filled glass and fills it.
C: GILLIS
D: Good party.
C: ARTIE
D: The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
E: To some guests who are dipping their empty cups into the punch bowl
C: GILLIS
D: Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
C: ARTIE
D: Sure, this'll go on all night.
C: GILLIS
D: I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
C: ARTIE
D: It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
C: GILLIS
D: I'll take it.
C: ARTIE
D: I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
N: He runs his finger across the decollete back of a girl standing in a group next them.
C: ARTIE
D: Just register here.
N: The girl turns around. She is Betty Schaefer.
C: BETTY
D: Hello, Mr. Gillis.
C: ARTIE
D: You know each other?
N: Gillis looks at her a little puzzled.
C: BETTY
D: Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
C: GILLIS
D: Sure. Bases Loaded.
C: ARTIE
D: Wait a minute. This is the woman I love. What's going on? Who was loaded?
C: GILLIS
D: Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.
C: BETTY
D: Hurt feelings department.
E: to Artie
C: GILLIS
D: About that luggage. Where's the phone?
C: ARTIE
D: Over by the Rainbow Room.
N: Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people to the telephone, which is next to an open door leading to the bathroom. The phone is busy. A girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly. Another girl beside her is laughing too. They are apparently sharing a conversation with some man on the other end of the wire. The telephone passes from hand to hand. Gillis watches impatiently, then
C: GILLIS
D: When youlre through with that thing, can I have it?
N: The girl just nods, going on with her chattering. Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up with his glass.
C: BETTY
D: You forgot this.
C: GILLIS
D: Thanks.
C: BETTY
D: I've been hoping to run into you.
C: GILLIS
D: What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
C: BETTY
D: I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
C: GILLIS
D: Why, you sweet kid.

D: There's one called....Window... something with a window.
C: GILLIS
D: Dark Windows. How did you like it?
C: BETTY
D: I didn't.
C: GILLIS
D: Thank you.

D: Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
N: There is too much racket for her.
C: BETTY
D: Is there someplace we can talk?
C: GILLIS
D: How about the Rainbow Room?
N: They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past Artie.
C: ARTIE
D: I said you could have my couch. I didn't say you could have my girl.
C: BETTY
D: This is shop talk.
N: She and Gillis go through the open door into C-20 ARTIE'S BATHROOM It's a little less noisy, although there are some guests there, chatting and having fun. Betty and Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub.
C: GILLIS
D: Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
C: BETTY
D: The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
C: GILLIS
D: I had a teacher like that once.
C: BETTY
D: Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...
C: GILLIS
D: Who wants true? Who wants moving?
C: BETTY
D: Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.
C: GILLIS
D: Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
C: BETTY
D: I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
C: GILLIS
D: I've got some ideas myself. One of them being this is New Year's Eve. How about living it up a little?
C: BETTY
D: As for instance?
C: GILLIS
D: Well....
C: BETTY
D: We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?
C: GILLIS
D: How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?

C: BETTY
D: I just got the recipe: take two packages of cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice --
N: Gillis looks up at her. Without a word he pushes her aside so that she spills the drink. He makes his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and rushes towards the door and out. Betty stands look- ing after him, completely bewildered.

C: GILLIS
D: I've got to run along. Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
C: BETTY
D: It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.

Her first number around her head with was always the Mack Sennett a rabbit's-ear bow. Bathing Beauty. She bats her eyes, winks roguishly. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Norma's black pyjama trousers are rolled up over her knees and her black stockings rolled down below them. The whole effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume pretty effectively. She points at a leather pour.
C: NORMA
D: This is a rock.
N: She climbs on it, pantomimes timidity, an attempted dive, then jumps off. Gillis lolls on a couch, watching the performance, very bored.
C: NORMA
D: I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling? Why are you so glum?
C: GILLIS
D: Nothing is the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.

C: NORMA'S VOICE
D: Open your eyes.
N: Gillis opens his eyes. Norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat, a cane, and blacked in a small moustache. She goes into a little Chaplin routine. While she is doing it, the telephone rings. After a moment Max comes to the living room door.

D: Madame is wanted on the telephone.

D: Paramount studios.
C: NORMA
D: Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
E: To Gillis
C: MAX
D: It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole. He says it's very important.
C: NORMA
D: Certainly it's important. It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an assistant call me!
C: MAX
D: I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
C: NORMA
D: Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
C: MAX
D: Very good, Madam.
N: He bows and exits.
C: NORMA
D: How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
C: GILLIS
D: Maybe deMille is shooting.

C: 1ST ASSISTANT
D: I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
N: By this time de Mille is on his feet.
C: DEMILLE
D: It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
C: 1ST ASSISTANT
D: I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...
C: DEMILLE
D: Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
C: 1ST ASSISTANT
D: I didn't mean to --
C: DEMILLE
D: Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
C: 1ST ASSISTANT
D: I hear she was a terror to work with.

N: She has reached him. They embrace.
C: NORMA
D: Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.

N: He leads her into D-13 STAGE 18 During the ensuing dialogue, Mr. deMille walks Norma towards the set.
C: DE MILLE
D: Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
C: NORMA
D: You'd better. I'm very angry.
C: DE MILLE
D: I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
C: NORMA
D: That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
C: DE MILLE
D: Yes, I did.
C: NORMA
D: Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
C: DE MILLE
D: What assistant?
C: NORMA
D: Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
C: DE MILLE
D: Gordon Cole?
C: NORMA
D: And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
C: DE MILLE
D: Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal. Make yourself comfortable.
E: Indicating his own chair
N: He walks onto the set, accompanied by his assistants.

E: Sotto voce, to his first assistant
N: Meanwhile, Norma starts to sit, sees the name MISS LAMARR on the chair and with a look of distaste changes and sits on the one marked C.B. DE MILLE. From somewhere comes

N: Norma waves at him.
C: NORMA
D: Hello.
N: Hog-eye points his light at her.
C: HOG-EYE
D: Let's get a look at you.
N: The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma. It hits her. She sits bathed in light. A couple of old costume extras recognize her.
C: EXTRAS
D: Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!
N: They rush over and start wringing her hand. Into the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: Hello, Miss Desmond. It's Bessie.

N: D-17 GORDON COLE, ON THE PHONE
C: COLE
D: It's that car of hers -- an old Isotta-Fraschini. Her chauffeur drove it on the lot the other day. It looks just right for the Crosby picture. We want to rent it for a couple of weeks.
N: D-18 DE MILLE ON THE PHONE
C: DE MILLE
D: Oh. Well, thank you.
E: Troubled
N: He hangs up, walks back towards Norma. (CAMERA WITH HIM). Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court. DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts away. The people about Norma disperse slowly with various ad-libs.
C: DE MILLE
D: Well, Norma ... I got hold of Gordon Cole.
E: He sits down next to her
N: Norma hasn't heard a word.
C: NORMA
D: Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
C: DE MILLE
D: You know, crazy things happen in this business. I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
N: Suddenly he realizes that she is crying. She takes the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her eyes.
C: DEMILLE
D: What's the matter, Norma?
C: NORMA
D: Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.
C: DEMILLE
D: We've missed you too, dear.
C: NORMA
D: We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
C: DEMILLE
D: That's what I want to talk to you about.
C: NORMA
D: It's a good script, isn't it?
C: DEMILLE
D: It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
C: NORMA
D: I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
C: DEMILLE
D: Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
C: NORMA
D: But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
N: The first assistant comes up.
C: 1ST ASSISTANT

D: That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
C: MAX
D: He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had the upstairs. See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
N: The words "Readers' Department" have registered on Gillis' mind. He gets out of the car.
C: GILLIS
D: I'll be with you in a minute.
N: He crosses the street towards the green staircase leading to the second floor. Meanwhile, two prop men walking down the street come into the SHOT.

E: To Max

D: Go away. Go away.
N: D-2O CUBICLE IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT Behind the desk sits Betty, typing the synopsis of a novel, a half-eaten apple marking her place. The door behind her opens and Gillis enters.
C: GILLIS
D: Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it. It's all yours.
C: BETTY
D: Well, for heaven's sake!
N: She moves the book and the apple aside and points at the free space on the desk.
C: BETTY
D: Have a chair.
N: Gillis sits on the desk.
C: GILLIS
D: I mean it. It's no good to me anyway. Help yourself.
C: BETTY
D: Why should you do that?
C: GILLIS
D: If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
C: BETTY
D: You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute. I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
C: GILLIS
D: What about all those ideas you had?
C: BETTY
D: See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
C: GILLIS
D: Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
C: BETTY
D: This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
C: GILLIS
D: Check.
C: BETTY
D: Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school. The first time they meet ...
N: From below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn.
C: GILLIS
D: Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
C: BETTY
D: I'll make it short.
C: GILLIS
D: Sorry. It's your baby now.
C: BETTY
D: I'm not good enough to write it alone. We'll have to do it together.
C: GILLIS
D: I'm all tied up. I can't.
C: BETTY
D: Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal. Artie is out of town.
C: GILLIS
D: What has Artie to do with it.
C: BETTY
D: We're engaged.
C: GILLIS
D: Good for you. You've got yourself the best guy in town.
C: BETTY
D: I think so. They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end. If you want, we could work at your place.
C: GILLIS
D: It's just impossible.
C: BETTY
D: Nobody can be that busy.
N: There is another honk: from down below.
C: GILLIS
D: Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
C: BETTY
D: You're tough, all right.
C: GILLIS
D: You're on your own. Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
C: BETTY
D: Honest to goodness, I hate you.
C: GILLIS
D: And don't make it too dreary. How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right? They don't even know each other, but they share the same room. It's cheaper that way. As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
E: Turning 1n the open door
C: BETTY
D: Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
C: GILLIS
D: So do I.
C: BETTY
D: Came on back. Let me show you where it fits in.
N: She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark Windows.
C: GILLIS
D: So long.
E: At the door
N: Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it after him.
C: BETTY
D: Oh, you --
C: GILLIS
D: And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
N: He ducks out quiokly, slamming the door behind him. Betty looks after him, then angrlly hurls the apple into the wastebasket. D-21 STAIRCASE OUTSIDE READERS' DEPARTMENT Max is rush1ng up the stairs toward the descending Gillis.
C: GILLIS
D: What's the matter, Max?

E: embracing him
N: She turns and walks out of the shot. De Mille stands for a second watching her, then turns to his assistant.
C: DE MILLE
D: Get Gordon Cole. Tell him to forget about her car. He can find another old car. I'll buy him five old cars, if necessary.

D: How did it go?
E: Apprehensively

D: It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
N: There is an exchange of looks between Max and Gillis.

C: NORMA
D: He'a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box office. Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

D: What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
C: GILLIS
D: I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
C: BETTY
D: It will?
C: GILLIS
D: Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
C: BETTY
D: Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
C: GILLIS
D: Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.
N: He resumes typing. Betty puts the water on. She picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk, finds it's empty and throws it away, sees Gillis' open gold cigarette case and lighter on the table by the couch. Betty reaches for a cigarette. The inscription en- graved inside the case catches her eye. It reads: MAD ABOUT THE BOY -- Norma
C: BETTY
D: Who's Norma?
C: GILLIS
D: Who's who?
C: BETTY
D: I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
C: GILLIS
D: Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine. A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
C: BETTY
D: I'll say. This is solid gold.
C: GILLIS
D: I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
C: BETTY
D: It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
C: GILLIS
D: That's the trouble with you readers. You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.

E-12 PARAMOUNT'S NEW YORK STREET (NIGHT) Betty and Gillis are walking down it, THE CAMERA AHEAD OF THEM.
C: BETTY
D: Look at this street. All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors. I like it better than any street in the world. Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
C: GILLIS
D: What were you -- a child actress?
C: BETTY
D: I was born just two blocks from this studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec- trician here till he died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.
C: GILLIS
D: Second generation, huh?
C: BETTY
D: Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
C: GILLIS
D: Nice job.
E: Examining her nose by the flame of his lighter
C: BETTY
D: Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
C: GILLIS
D: Saddest thing I ever heard.
C: BETTY
D: Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
C: GILLIS
D: Come clean, Betty. At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
C: BETTY
D: Not once. What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
C: GILLIS
D: Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
C: BETTY
D: If you please.
N: Gillis kisses her nose. As he stands there, his face close to hers -
C: GILLIS
D: May I say you smell real special.
C: BETTY
D: It must be my new shampoo.
C: GILLIS
D: That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile. How old are you anyway?
C: BETTY
D: Twenty-two.
C: GILLIS
D: That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two. Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... Now back to the typewriter.
N: They start walking in the direction of the office.

N: E-13 THE GARAGE Gillis gets out. From the seat next him he takes a batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket. He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns. Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for him.
C: GILLIS
D: What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
C: MAX
D: You must be very careful as you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.
C: GILLIS
D: How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
C: MAX
D: I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
C: GILLIS
D: Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
C: MAX
D: It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
C: GILLIS
D: Sure you are. And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture ... What happens when she finds out?
C: MAX
D: She never will. That is my job. It has been for a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen. I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed.
C: GILLIS
D: You made her a star?
C: MAX
D: I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
C: GILLIS
D: And she's turned you into a servant.
C: MAX
D: It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem. I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me. You see, I was her rirst husband.

N: Her eyes fall on Gillis' coat, which hangs over a chair. In a pocket is part of the script. Norma takes it out, looks at it. She can't see it in the moonlight. She hurries with it into: E-16 NORMA'S BEDROOM Carrying the script Norma goes to the lamp and looks at it. On the first page she sees something which confirms all her suspicionso It reads:

N: E-17 BETTY'S CUBICLE (NIGHT) Betty is typing. Gillis sits on the couch, proof- reading a scene. Betty stops typing and Gillis becomes aware of her eyes fixed on him.
C: GILLIS
D: Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up! Why are you staring at me like that?
E: He whistles and catches her attention
C: BETTY
D: Was I? I'm sorry.
C: GILLIS
D: What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
C: BETTY
D: Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
C: GILLIS
D: Why not?
C: BETTY
D: I just don't.
C: GILLIS
D: What is it you've heard. Come on, let's have it.
N: Betty gets up.
C: GILLIS
D: Is it about me?
N: Betty doesn't answer, walks out on E-18 THE BALCONY She leans against a post, crying. Gillis comes out after her.
C: GILLIS
D: Betty, there's no use running out on it. Let's face it, what- ever it is.
C: BETTY
D: It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
C: GILLIS
D: From Artie. What's wrong?
C: BETTY
D: He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
C: GILLIS
D: Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
N: Betty stands crying silently.
C: GILLIS
D: Stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you've always wanted.
C: BETTY
D: I don't want it now.
C: GILLIS
D: Why not? Don't you love Artie?
C: BETTY
D: Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.

Maybe I could get away with it, get away from Norma. Maybe I could wipe the whole nasty mess right out of my life... From Norma's room comes the sound of a telephone being dialled. Gillis enters the shot and stands listening.
C: NORMA'S VOICE
D: Is this Gladstone 0858?
C: E-21 NORMA'S BEDROOM
D: Norma lies in bed, dialing a number. She has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over her nose.
C: NORMA
D: Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer? She must be home by now.
N: E-22 A BEDROOM IN BETTY'S FLAT Connie, a girl of Betty's age with whom she shares the flat, is on the phone. Betty, in a dressing- gown, comes from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand.

E: Hand over mouthpiece
C: BETTY
D: What is this anyway? This is Betty Schaefer.
E: Taking the phone
N: E-23 NORMA AT IHE PHONE
C: NORMA
D: Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but I really feel it's my duty. It's about Mr. Gillis. You do know Mr. Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you know about him? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how he lives? Do you know what he lives on?
N: E-24 BETTY AT THE PHONE
C: BETTY
D: Who are you? What do you want? What business is it of yours anyway?
N: E-25 NORMA ON THE PHONE
C: NORMA
D: Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do you a favor. I'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery. Of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort...
N: NORMA (Cont'd) I don't know what he's told you, but he does not live with relatives, nor with friends, in the usual sense of the word. Ask him ... Ask him again. During the latter part of her call, the doors from Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has walked towards her. Suddenly Norma senses his pre- sence and turns around. The telephone freezes in her hand. She tries to hang it up. Very calmly Gillis takes the receiver from her hand.
C: GILLIS
D: That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe.
E: Into phone
N: E-26 BETTY ON THE PHONE
C: BETTY
D: Joe, where are you? What's this all about?
N: E-27 GILLIS ON THE PHONE Norma beside him.
C: GILLIS
D: Or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself. The address is 10086
N: He hangs up. Norma looks up at him as he crosses to the other end of the room and stands staring at her. The silence becomes unbearable.
C: NORMA
D: Don't hate me, Joe. I did it because I need you. I need you as I never needed you. Look at me. Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes. How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment? You don't know what I've been through these last weeks. I got myself a revolver. You don't believe me, but I did, I did! I stood in front of that mirror, only I couldn't make myself. It wouldn't be
N: NORMA (Cont'd) fair to all those people who are waiting to see me back on the screen. I can't disappoint them. Only, if I'm to work, I need sleep, I need quiet, I need you! Don't just stand there hating me! Shout at me, strike me! But don't hate me, Joe. Don't you hear me, Joe?
C: GILLIS
D: Yes, I hear you. And I wish you'd keep still so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it.
N: E-28 BETTY AND CONNIE, DRIVING IN A SMALL COUPE DOWN (NIGHT)
S: E-29 INT. COUPE
N: Connie is looking at the house numbers.
C: CONNIE
D: Here's ten thousand seventy-nine, Betty. It must be over there.
N: Betty turns the car into the driveway of Norma's place, stops at the entrance steps. Betty gets out.
C: CONNIE
D: Betty, let me come along with you. Please.
C: BETTY
D: No, I'll be all right.
N: She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps. E-30 NORMA'S BEDROOM Norma lies on the bed. Gillis sits in a far corner of the room, motionless.
C: NORMA
D: I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe.
E: In a whimpering monotone
N: There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing of a doorbell. Gillis rises.
C: NORMA
D: What are you going to do, Joe?
N: Without a word, he leaves the room. Norma raises herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee lying at the foot of it. As she does so, she dis- lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver hidden beneath it. E-31 DOWNSTAIRS HALL, THE DESMOND HOUSE (DARK) Max crosses the hall, putting on his alpaca jacket. He turns on the lights. Outside stands Betty. From the staircase comes -
C: GILLIS' VOICE
D: It's all right, Max. I'll take it.
C: MAX
D: Yes, sir.
N: He stands back as Gillis opens the door.
C: GILLIS
D: Hello, Betty.
C: BETTY
D: I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
E: On the threshold
C: GILLIS
D: Come on in, Betty,
N: Betty enters. As he leads her into the living room, Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders.
C: GILLIS
D: Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes. Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
C: BETTY
D: This is where you live?
C: GILLIS
D: You bet.
C: BETTY
D: Whose house is it?
N: They have reached E-32 THE LIVING ROOM Gillis leads Betty in.
C: GILLIS
D: Hers.
C: BETTY
D: Whose?
C: GILLIS
D: Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
C: BETTY
D: That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
C: GILLIS
D: Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
C: BETTY
D: Why did she call me?
C: GILLIS
D: Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.
N: He pulls the rope, showing the projection screen under the picture.
C: GILLIS
D: Her own movie theatre.
C: BETTY
D: I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
C: GILLIS
D: I'm trying to tell you. This is an enormous place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom. There's a bowling alley in the cellar. It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do. A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
C: BETTY
D: No.
C: GILLIS
D: All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
C: BETTY
D: No, no! I haven't heard any of this. I never got those telephone calls. I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
C: GILLIS
D: All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
C: BETTY
D: Come on, Joe.
C: GILLIS
D: Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
C: BETTY
D: If you love me, Joe.
C: GILLIS
D: Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way. Maybe it's not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
C: BETTY
D: Joe, I can't look at you any more.
C: GILLIS
D: Nobody asked you to.
N: Betty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is crying.
C: GILLIS
D: All right, baby. This way out.
N: He leads her in the direction of the door. E-33 UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE Sitting crouched behind the balustrade is Norma, peering down into E-34 THE LOWER HALL Betty and Gillis have reached the entrance door. Gillis opens it.
C: GILLIS
D: Good luck to you, Betty. You can finish that story on the way to Arizona. When you and Artie get back, if the two of you ever feel like a swim, here's the pool ...
N: He switches on the light. E-35 THE PATIO The lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant- ly in the dark garden. E-36 BETTY She doesn't even look. Her eyes filled with tears, she runs down the entrance porch toward her car. E-37 THE ENTRANCE HALL Gillis looks after her, closes the door. From the upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing. He looks up. E-38 NORMA, ON THE UPPER LANDING Gillis ascends the stairs.
C: NORMA
D: Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe.
N: She tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes. He doesn't stop. Norma catches his coat. Gillis moves right on into his room. Norma lies on the floor looking after him. She crawls toward a con- sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis' door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves back to the mirror and takes the patches off her face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis' room.
C: NORMA
D: May I come in? I've stopped cry- ing. I'm all right again. Joe, tell me you're not cross -- tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.
N: She opens the door. E-39 GILLIS' ROOM In the foreground, open on the bed, is a half-packed suitcase, Gillis just putting some of his old shirts in. Norma stands staring, speechless, for a second. Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets.
C: NORMA
D: What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
C: GILLIS
D: Yes, I am, Norma.
C: NORMA
D: No, you're not. Max! Max!
E: Calling
C: GILLIS
D: Max is a good idea. He can help with my luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe. And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
E: He gestures in the direction of the closet
N: He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the chaise longue. Then he throws the lighter, the wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip.
C: GILLIS
D: The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
E: Indicating the bureau
C: NORMA
D: It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
C: GILLIS
D: And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
C: NORMA
D: These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?
C: GILLIS
D: Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
C: NORMA
D: You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
C: GILLIS
D: That's between you and yourself, Norma.
C: NORMA
D: You think I made that up about the gun...
N: She rushes into her room. Gillis closes the suitcase calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff- links Norma gave him, takes them off. Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.
C: NORMA
D: See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
C: GILLIS
D: Oh. sure -- if it would make a good scene.
C: NORMA
D: You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
C: GILLIS
D: Wake up, Norma. You'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
N: During the preceding. Max has entered. He stands listening, paralyzed.
C: NORMA
D: That's a lie! They still want me!
C: GILLIS
D: No, they don't.
C: NORMA
D: What about the studio? What about De Mille?
C: GILLIS
D: He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
C: NORMA
D: Wanted what?
C: GILLIS
D: De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.
C: NORMA
D: That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!
C: GILLIS
D: You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
C: NORMA
D: That isn't true! Max?
C: MAX
D: Madame is the greatest star of them all... I will take Mr. Gillis' bags.
N: He leaves.
C: NORMA
D: You heard him. I'm a star!
C: GILLIS
D: Norma, grow up. You're a woman of fifty. There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
C: NORMA
D: I'm the greatest star of them all.
C: GILLIS
D: Goodbye. Norma.
C: NORMA
D: No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.

D: You're not leaving me!
N: E-40 STAIRCASE Gillis descending with the typewriter.
C: NORMA'S VOICE
D: Joe! ...Joe!
N: There is the SOUND OF A SHOT. The glass of the front door is shattered. Gillis at the door opens it and walks out, without looking back. Down the staircase rushes Norma. a disordered wild- ness in the way she moves.
C: NORMA
D: You're not leaving me!
N: She hurries after Gillis. E-41 PATIO (NIGHT) Dark except for lights from the house and the luminousness of the lit pool. Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage. He is carrying the typewriter. He doesn't accelerate his step, although he has heard the shot. Behind him Norma comes from the lighted house.
C: NORMA
D: You're not leaving me!
N: She shoots twice in rapid succession. Gillis drops the typewriter. The shots have swung him around. He is now facing Norma. She shoots him. This shot hits him in the belly. He doubles up, instinctively backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool. Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max. He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.
C: NORMA
D: Stars are ageless, aren't they?
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: E-42 THE PATIO Dawn is breaking. At the edge of the pool stand policemen, detectives and police photographers. Motorcycle policemen are holding off the mob which is trying to storm the house. A lietuenant from the Homicide Bureau leaves the crowd around the pool and goes into E-43 THE LOWER HALL, DESMOND HOUSE It is filled with a pandemonium of police officers, newspaper people, etc. who are kept from the upper floor by two policemen at the head of the stairs. The lieutenant from the Homicide Bureau goes through the crowd to the telephone at the foot of the stairs, picks up the phone and dials.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Coroner's office? ... I want to speak to the Coroner ... Who's on this phone?
N: E-44 THE WHITE TELEPHONE IN NORMA'S BEDROOM Standing talking into it is Hedda Hopper.
C: MISS HOPPER
D: I am! Now get off, this is more important ... Times City Desk? Hedda Hopper speaking. I'm talking from the bedroom of Norma Desmond. Don't bother with a rewrite man, take this direct. Ready? -- As day breaks over the murder house, Norma Desmond, famed star of yesteryear, is in a state of complete mental shock ...
N: THE CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BEDROOM, where Norma sits at a mirror, staring at herself blankly. Firing questions at her are the Captain of the Holmby Hills Division and the L.A. Homicide Squad. Max stands by faithfully.
C: HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
