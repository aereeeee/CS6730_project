S: EXT. PITTSBURGH, PA - TWILIGHT
N: A beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges. Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh.
S: EXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME
N: PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.
S: EXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER
N: Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view, Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue- collar neighborhood high above the city.
S: EXT. HOUSE - SAME
N: TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the approaching night.
S: EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his eyes.
C: PADDY
D: Tommy?
N: Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
C: PADDY
D: What're you doing here?
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man.
N: Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
C: TOMMY
D: She looks good.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: Yeah, she's hanging in there.
E: patting car hood
C: TOMMY
D: Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities.
N: Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
C: TOMMY
D: Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy.
C: TOMMY
D: What? You change brands?
N: Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not drinking? What gives?
C: PADDY
D: C'mon, let's go inside.
N: Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused Tommy follows. TITLE CARD: WARRIOR
S: INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
C: TOMMY
D: I like what you've done with the place.
C: PADDY
D: Appreciate that.
E: O.S.
N: The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair.
C: TOMMY
D: There's not much of a woman's touch around here.
C: PADDY
D: No more women for me, Tommy.
E: O.S.
C: TOMMY
D: Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.
N: Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
C: PADDY
D: Here you go.
C: TOMMY
D: Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him?
C: PADDY
D: I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days.
C: TOMMY
D: C'mon, just one drink.
C: PADDY
D: No.
N: Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos. He takes them in. FRAMED PHOTO OF: 12-YEAR-OLD TOMMY, IN A WRESTLING UNIFORM

Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.
C: PADDY
D: He's a school teacher down in Philly.
E: CONT'D OFF PICTURE
N: Tommy's face registers surprise.
C: PADDY
D: Remember Tess? They've got two beautiful little girls.
E: CONT'D
N: Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
C: TOMMY
D: So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew?
N: Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
C: TOMMY
D: So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober?
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: I know.
C: TOMMY
D: Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too.
C: PADDY
D: When I got sober I hired a man to find you.
C: TOMMY
D: Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24?
E: taking a swig
C: PADDY
D: Just the 12.
C: TOMMY
D: Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?
C: PADDY
D: Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was enough.
C: TOMMY
D: That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details.
N: Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. MOBY DICK.
C: TOMMY
D: You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that?
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: I'm sorry, Tommy.
C: TOMMY
D: It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way.
N: Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
C: TOMMY
D: I think I liked you better when you were a drunk.
E: CONT'D
N: An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out. Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son. Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.
S: EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
N: A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY. TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA. She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up. THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.
C: TESS
D: What's going on here?
C: BRENDAN
D: Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess.
N: Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here" expression.
C: TESS
D: Em, you want to open your presents?
N: The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around. Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
C: TESS
D: This an awfully big box.
E: CONT'D off pink box
C: BRENDAN
D: It's her birthday.
N: Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
C: TESS
D: I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge.
E: TEASING
N: Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
S: EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set. She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan pressing free weights on an old bench.
S: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make- up, is visible on his cheek.
C: TESS
D: Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath.
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm on it.
C: TESS
D: Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're exhausted.
N: Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.
C: BRENDAN
D: Where's the rest of that skirt?
C: TESS
D: Babe.
C: BRENDAN
D: Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay?
C: TESS
D: Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.
E: off his cut
C: BRENDAN
D: I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action.
C: TESS
D: Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that.
N: Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
C: BRENDAN
D: Promises, promises.
S: INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
N: A big, old-school warehouse, where a handful of GUYS whale away at MMA punching dummies and roll around on sweat- saturated mats. Sun slants through a dirty, industrial skylight. A no frills kind of gym. Behind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and watches ESPN's "MMA LIVE" on a laptop. ON COMPUTER SCREEN: ESPN ANCHOR JON ANIK INTERVIEWS PROMOTER J.J. RILEY, AND PUNKASS AND SKYSKRAPE FROM TAPOUT.
C: JON ANIK
D: And we return here on MMA Live, Jon Anik alongside billionaire fight promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout crew is also here. Punk and Skrape are in the building. Now J.J., what led to this project that is redefining Mixed Martial Arts here in the States?
E: ON SCREEN
C: J.J. RILEY
D: Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport that I've always been incredibly passionate about. As for where the idea for Sparta came from, I've always kind of dug the Grand Prix format, so I tracked these guys down to help me out.
E: ON SCREEN
C: PUNKASS
D: When J.J. came to us he said he wanted to create the Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts.
E: ON SCREEN
C: SKRAPE
D: And he decided to put up the five million dollar purse, too.
E: ON SCREEN
C: JON ANIK
D: Well, there you have it. It shall be done. Hedge fund king J.J. Riley, going from the lion's den of Wall Street to the cage, promoting the biggest winner-take-all tournament in MMA history. Sparta.
E: ON SCREEN
N: As Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with curiosity, and approaches the front desk.
C: TOMMY
D: Fitzy still own this?
C: FENROY
D: Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns this gym.
N: Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE. ATLANTIC CITY, JULY 2-3. BIGGEST WINNER TAKE ALL IN MMA HISTORY!"
C: FENROY
D: Can I help you with something?
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: How's it work here?
C: FENROY
D: Thirty five a month with locker. We're open at 7, lights out at 11. You wanna join?
C: TOMMY
D: Sure.
N: Fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the counter in front of Tommy.
C: FENROY
D: Put your name and contact info on the card.
S: INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
N: Brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates CHEER him on.
C: BRENDAN
D: Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs--
C: TITO
D: Acceleration.
C: BRENDAN
D: Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead.
N: Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF MOTION" printed on it.
C: BRENDAN
D: There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
E: CONT'D
N: As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things settle down and the kids take their seats.
C: BRENDAN
D: So, have we got it?
E: CONT'D
N: A room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out.
C: NASH
D: Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it.
C: BRENDAN
D: Alright. The third law--
N: A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.
C: STEPHON
D: How many laws this dude got?
C: BRENDAN
D: The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
E: LAUGHING
N: Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and- white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.
C: BRENDAN
D: For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class...
E: CONT'D
N: Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books.
C: BRENDAN
D: ...and tell her posse outside to beat it...
E: CONT'D
N: He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window.
C: BRENDAN
D: ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance.
E: CONT'D
C: KC
D: Mr. C, I put it away.
N: The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.
C: BRENDAN
D: Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week.
S: INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
N: Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer. Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming Sparta tournament. Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s), is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important. In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as Mad Dog laughs.
C: MAD DOG
D: Where do you find these girls?
N: Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter. Glances at Mad Dog.
C: COLT BOYD
D: We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks.
E: TO FENROY
C: TOMMY
D: Yo, I'll fight him.
N: Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.
N: Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's outfit.
C: MAD DOG
D: Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today?
N: Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
C: FENROY
D: His phone's disconnected.
E: TO COLT
C: COLT BOYD
D: Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones.
C: TOMMY
D: All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.
E: TO COLT
N: Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral.
C: COLT BOYD
D: You ever fought before?
C: TOMMY
D: Yeah.
N: Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.
C: COLT BOYD
D: This guy sign a waiver?
E: TO FENROY
C: FENROY
D: All good.
C: COLT BOYD
D: What's your name?
C: TOMMY
D: Tommy.
C: COLT BOYD
D: You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy.
C: TOMMY
D: Sure, no problem.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Come on in.
N: Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring. A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves. He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
C: MAD DOG
D: Gonna be a hero? Alright.
N: He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and Colt Boyd. Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring. Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face. Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away. Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS. SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and approaches him.
C: TOMMY
D: You owe me two hundred bucks.
S: INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY
N: Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR (40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon.
C: BRENDAN
D: Brendan.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that.
C: BRENDAN
D: I teach Physics.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage--
C: BRENDAN
D: You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure--
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Well, you've already refinanced twice.
C: BRENDAN
D: Because you advised us to do that.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: I presented you with that option. It was your choice. I'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi.
E: BEAT
C: BRENDAN
D: We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file?
N: Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's...kidney?
C: BRENDAN
D: Heart.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Heart, right. Lot of stories.
E: off stack of files on desk
N: Brendan glares at him.
C: BRENDAN
D: So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me?
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even--
C: BRENDAN
D: 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest?
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days.
C: BRENDAN
D: That's not how I do things.
C: DAN TAYLOR
D: Well, then you're looking at foreclosure.
N: Brendan gets up and storms out of the office. ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Utter domination by Tommy Conlon, the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh...
S: INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads: 1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY. ON TV SCREEN: 14-YEAR-OLD TOMMY DOMINATES AN OPPONENT. ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) ...the prodigy has yet to yield a single point in the entire tournament. It's just unprecedented. ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) Tommy trained by his father since the age of five. ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) You're talking about Paddy Conlon. ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) The controversial Paddy Conlon. ON TV SCREEN: A YOUNGER PADDY SHOUTS INSTRUCTIONS AS TOMMY CRUSHES HIS OPPONENT. ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Say what you will about the methods of the former Marine, but he's led his son to six straight junior Olympic titles, and now just moments away from a high school state championship. And there it is! Wow! ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY PINS HIS OPPONENT AND LEAPS OFF THE MAT IN JUBILATION. ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) There's just no limit to what the future holds for this kid! As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the door as the tape continues to play. ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Tommy told me that he's chasing the record of Theogenes, apparently a mythical Greek fighter said to be unbeaten in over 1400 bouts... Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.
C: COLT BOYD
D: How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.
N: Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
C: PADDY
D: Who?
C: COLT BOYD
D: Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
C: PADDY
D: What business you got with Tommy?
C: COLT BOYD
D: None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters.
N: Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Tommy's been working out at my gym. He put a beating on the number one middleweight contender in the world today. I want to know more about the guy. Maybe help him out. I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself.
C: COLT BOYD
D: I'm just looking for some general information here.
C: PADDY
D: Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym.
C: PADDY
D: He doesn't live here.
N: Paddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt.
S: INT. BRENDAN'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Brendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and talks on his cell.
C: BRENDAN
D: Listen kiddo, I need you put Mommy back on, OK? I love you. Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh, they've got this open mic night thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep well. You too. Bye.
E: INTO PHONE BEAT
S: EXT. THE TENDER TRAP - NIGHT
N: Brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club. A white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is overflowing with cars. Something big going on.
S: INT. TENDER TRAP TENT - SAME
N: Aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where TWO AMATEUR FIGHTERS go at it under a bank of sodium lights. Hundreds of rowdy LOCALS swill beer and BOO lustily when the action slows.
S: INT. TENDER TRAP RING - LATER
N: MIKE MOORE (20s), a FIGHTER sporting sleeves of demonic ink, paces in his corner as a cluster of BIKERS cheer him on from ringside. An ANNOUNCER walks to the center of the ring with a cordless microphone.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: It's time for our next contest! Introducing first, fighting out of the red corner, from Ripley, West Virginia, please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore!
N: Some hollers from the crowd.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And in the blue corner. He fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon!
E: CONT'D
N: Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: This bout is scheduled for three five-minute rounds, and when the action begins your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.
E: CONT'D
N: The REFEREE enters the ring and stands between Brendan and Mike Moore.
C: REFEREE
D: Fighters to the center! I want you to obey my commands at all times. If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. Come out fighting!
N: Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to his corner.
C: REFEREE
D: Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!
E: CONT'D
N: The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at him with his huge hands. Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face and body. It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally, mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers. A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.
C: PROMOTER
D: Nice fight. Two more wins and you take home the bacon.
S: INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The bedroom door opens and Brendan creeps through the room and into the bathroom.
S: INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BATHROOM - SAME
N: It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess shuffles in.
C: TESS
D: Hey babe. How was work?
E: SLEEPY
N: Brendan doesn't answer. Tess slowly wakes up. As she does, she gets a look at his face.
C: TESS
D: Oh my God. What happened? You said it was going to be a slow night.
E: CONT'D
N: Tess studies his face. Brendan looks at her. Reaches into his pocket and hands her $500 in cash.
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm not bouncing at a club.
C: TESS
D: What do you mean you're not bouncing?
N: She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.
C: TESS
D: You've been lying to me?
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing.
N: Tess can't believe what she's hearing.
C: BRENDAN
D: They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out OF OPTIONS--
E: CONT'D
C: TESS
D: Then they'll put us out of the house in three months. I'd rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again. I thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living.
E: FURIOUS BEAT
C: BRENDAN
D: We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going BACKWARDS
N: Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself down. Embraces her husband.
C: TESS
D: We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to.
S: EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING
N: A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the shadow of the railroad tracks.
S: INT. DINER - SAME
N: Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich, he's been there a while. The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him.
C: PADDY
D: You wanted to talk?
C: TOMMY
D: Yeah. I'm gonna start fighting.
E: BEAT
C: PADDY
D: That right?
C: TOMMY
D: Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you.
C: PADDY
D: Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.
C: TOMMY
D: We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did.
N: Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate.
C: TOMMY
D: Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything.
E: CONT'D off Paddy grinning
N: Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at him sternly.
C: TOMMY
D: I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: What about Colt Boyd?
C: TOMMY
D: What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know.
C: PADDY
D: Ah, the devil you know.
C: TOMMY
D: Excuse me?
C: PADDY
D: The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
N: Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.
C: PADDY
D: Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda like old times.
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking.
E: ANGRY
N: Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left.
C: PADDY
D: Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em.
N: Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy away.
C: PADDY
D: In fact, hand `em over right now. I know they're on you, Tommy. You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door.
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: Tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two bottles across the table.
C: PADDY
D: That's not gonna do. When you came through that door it was chhh-chhh-chhh. Three.
E: CONT'D SHAKING BOTTLES holding up 3 fingers
N: Tommy looks at him. Fishes another bottle out of his pocket and flips it on the table.
C: PADDY
D: And another thing, you don't eat crap like this. This is for losers and old men. And we're gonna have to bunk up. If we're gonna do this right, you gotta stay at the house.
E: CONT'D off French fries BEAT MORE
C: PADDY
D: I watch your diet, we follow the old regimen. You copy?
E: CONT'D
N: The two men stare at each other. Tommy looks furious, but he doesn't get up. A silent, tenuous agreement is reached.
C: PADDY
D: Copy.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CENTRAL HIGH HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Brendan, his face BRUISED badly from the night before, walks down the hallway toward his classroom. STUDENTS watch him as he passes and whisper.
S: INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME
N: The class is filled with the kind of BUZZING that can only rise off a major rumor. Tito, Nash, KC, and Stephon discuss.
C: TITO
D: My brother said he was at the strip club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
C: NASH
D: What's MMA?
C: STEPHON
D: Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different styles of fighting.
C: KC
D: Your brother's a liar.
N: Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit. It's true.
C: BRENDAN
D: Take your seats.
N: Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He is not amused by the murmuring in there.
C: BRENDAN
D: Now, please.
E: CONT'D
N: The kids pipe down. Then Tito speaks up.
C: TITO
D: Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out. What's up? Is it true?
C: STEPHON
D: Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really work on some fools or something?
C: KC
D: You have to tell us.
N: Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO (50s) gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - LATER
N: Zito, puffy faced, hair getting thinner by the hour, hangs up his phone as Brendan pokes his head in. Zito waves him in. Eyeballs the marks on his face.
C: BRENDAN
D: C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
C: JOE ZITO
D: Are you being literal or figurative? Because literally it looks bad. And figuratively it looks even worse. The superintendent's coming by in a few minutes. So gimme a little help here, Brendan. Can you explain to me what the hell you were doing?
C: BRENDAN
D: I need the money, Joe.
C: JOE ZITO
D: Yeah, but we can't have this. This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's for Christ's sake.
N: Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.
C: JOE ZITO
D: Shit, Brendan. Leaving everything else aside, which we can't, are you out of your mind? You're gonna get yourself killed. I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: JOE ZITO
D: You've got no business in the ring with those animals.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: Actually, I used to be one of those animals.
N: Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.
C: BRENDAN
D: I fought for a living. Guess I forgot to put that down on my application.
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: JOE ZITO
D: Yeah, I guess you did.
N: Zito sits back down.
C: BRENDAN
D: Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
C: JOE ZITO
D: Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.
C: BRENDAN
D: It was the parking lot of a strip club.
C: JOE ZITO
D: Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here.
N: Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his office. He's looking none too pleased.
C: JOE ZITO
D: This is a serious problem. Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11.
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: BRENDAN
D: What are we gonna do?
C: JOE ZITO
D: You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood.
N: Brendan and Joe stand up. Zito can't tether down a slight grin.
C: JOE ZITO
D: UFC?
E: CONT'D
N: Brendan nods. Joe shakes his head. Impressed.
C: JOE ZITO
D: Sonofabitch.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - KID'S PLAYROOM - NIGHT
N: Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom, putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom. They speak in whispers.
C: TESS
D: What are you doing?
C: BRENDAN
D: The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction. How'd it go?
E: OFF PIANO BEAT
C: TESS
D: They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his attorney.
C: BRENDAN
D: How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?
N: Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the floor.
C: TESS
D: He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
C: BRENDAN
D: That was nice.
C: TESS
D: He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next semester.
C: BRENDAN
D: Next semester?
N: Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions. Finally, Brendan speaks up.
C: BRENDAN
D: Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat.
E: CONT'D
C: TESS
D: You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop?
C: BRENDAN
D: Some of them pay a little more than that. I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night.
E: BEAT
N: Brendan looks at his wife.
C: BRENDAN
D: And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears.
E: CONT'D
N: Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options.
C: TESS
D: What are we gonna tell the girls?
C: BRENDAN
D: It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym.
N: They look at each other. No choice. This is the plan.
S: INT. TOMMY'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN
N: Paddy climbs the stairs with a POSTER BOARD tucked under his arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room, which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES, Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously once belonged to Brendan.
C: PADDY
D: Oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo, and the old red rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo.
E: SINGING
N: Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster. It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting. ON BOARD: THEOGENES 1415 WINS. NO LOSSES. TOMMY CONLON 315 WINS. NO LOSSES. ALSO, A 1994 NEWSPAPER CLIPPING READING "PRODIGY WINS STATE CHAMPIONSHIP," AND ABOVE IT, GOALS: 1998, COLLEGE, PENN STATE. 2000, SUMMER OLYMPICS, GOLD MEDAL.
C: PADDY
D: Look what I found in that disaster of a basement. Whattya say we sit down and update this sometime? You can fill me in on how close you got to that record.
E: CONT'D
N: Tommy says nothing. Not a nostalgic bone in his body. The dreams on that poster are long gone.
C: PADDY
D: Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother? C'mon, Tommy. Tell me something.
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: TOMMY
D: Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too.
N: Paddy's stung but covers it amiably.
C: PADDY
D: OK. Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway.
E: BEAT MORE
C: PADDY
D: Coffee pot's on til 0-500, then I dump it.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. AL ADAD AIR BASE, RAMADI, IRAQ - DAY
N: Marine base camp in the middle of the Iraqi desert. Blackhawk HELICOPTERS floating in the sky. MARINES rushing about.
S: INT. MARINES COMMUNICATIONS TENT, RAMADI, IRAQ - SAME
N: MARINES of various rank huddle around a computer screen, fired up about something they're watching. MARINE #1 Damn dude, that's brutal. LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD (20s) walks up to see what the commotion is all about.
C: BRADFORD
D: What's that?
N: MARINE #2 "Mad Dog" Grimes gettin' tuned up by some dude in a gym in Pittsburgh.
C: BRADFORD
D: Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?
N: MARINE #2 Shit, Bradford. The stuff you don't know amazes me. (OFF COMPUTER) Oh my god, did you see that? ON COMPUTER SCREEN: YOU TUBE VIDEO OF THE CELL PHONE FOOTAGE FENROY TOOK OF TOMMY BEATING UP ON MAD DOG GRIMES. THE MOHAWKED FIGHTER IS CRUSHED BY THE LEFT HOOK AND FALLS BETWEEN THE ROPES. Bradford stares at the screen, his eyes widening as the Marines raise hell about the footage.
C: BRADFORD
D: Wait, rewind that.
N: One of the Marines rewinds the video. Bradford looks at the image in disbelief, then races out of the tent.
S: EXT. BRAVO COMPANY COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS
N: Bradford hustles outside into the searing sunlight.
S: INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Bradford enters a barracks, where Private "AV" SIMERS (20s) plays cards with other MARINES.
C: BRADFORD
D: AV, I need to see the tape!
C: AV
D: What tape?
C: BRADFORD
D: The tape.
N: AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for, loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY. ON VIDEO SCREEN: A CHAOTIC FIRE FIGHT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. MUZZLE FLASHES. TRACER LIGHTS. MAYHEM. THE CAMERA FOCUSES ON A FLIPPED TANK, HALF OF IT SUBMERGED IN WATER. A MARINE, HEAD SHAVED BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY TOMMY, SUDDENLY APPEARS AND CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE TANK, REACHING FOR THE HATCH.
C: BRADFORD
D: Freeze.
N: AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy.

E: CONT'D
S: INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY
N: In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS. The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air.
C: FRANK
D: Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
N: As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great trainer notices him and walks over.
C: FRANK
D: Do I know you? I think I know you.
E: CONT'D
N: They embrace warmly.
C: FRANK
D: Long time, brother.
E: CONT'D

C: FRANK
D: Come on back.
N: The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.
S: INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini- fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down.
C: FRANK
D: You look good, brother. How're the girls?
C: BRENDAN
D: Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
C: FRANK
D: I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called.
C: BRENDAN
D: It's alright.
C: FRANK
D: No, Brendan. I'm sorry.
C: BRENDAN
D: It's all good. She's good now.
N: Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.
C: FRANK
D: It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good?
C: BRENDAN
D: Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually.
N: Frank considers what he's hearing.
C: FRANK
D: I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need?
C: BRENDAN
D: I didn't come here for a loan, Frank. I was hoping you'd train me.
E: BEAT
C: FRANK
D: Train you for what?
C: BRENDAN
D: I want to get back in the cage.
N: Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees Brendan is not smiling with him.
C: FRANK
D: You're serious?
C: BRENDAN
D: I just won an event the other night.
C: FRANK
D: Ah, you won an event. That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right?
E: off bruised face
N: Brendan smiles.
C: BRENDAN
D: Ish.
C: FRANK
D: Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?
C: BRENDAN
D: I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers.
C: FRANK
D: Tess know about this? Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?
E: off Brendan's nod
C: BRENDAN
D: No. I was unconscious.
N: The two friends share a laugh.
C: FRANK
D: She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?
C: BRENDAN
D: It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan.
C: BRENDAN
D: That's all I need.
N: Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.
C: BRENDAN
D: I appreciate it.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: Let me know when you're coming down.
C: BRENDAN
D: Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car.
E: WALKING AWAY
C: FRANK
D: Now?
N: Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his head.
S: EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door. Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there, uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street lamp.
C: PADDY
D: Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
C: BRENDAN
D: What're you doing here?
C: PADDY
D: I have some news for you.
C: BRENDAN
D: Something wrong with your hands?
N: Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
C: BRENDAN
D: If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. That's the deal.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: Yeah, I forgot--
C: BRENDAN
D: Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
N: Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
C: PADDY
D: Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you?
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm going inside.
C: PADDY
D: I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today.
C: BRENDAN
D: Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything.
C: PADDY
D: What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
N: Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
C: BRENDAN
D: You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do.
C: PADDY
D: C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication.
C: BRENDAN
D: You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is.
C: PADDY
D: I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met.
C: BRENDAN
D: Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that?
N: Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
C: BRENDAN
D: That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here.
E: CONT'D
N: Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on his face. Then he heads for the house.
C: BRENDAN
D: Take care of yourself.
E: CONT'D
N: As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.
C: PADDY
D: Tommy's back.
N: Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
C: PADDY
D: He's in the `Burgh.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
C: PADDY
D: He came to see me.
C: BRENDAN
D: He came to see you?
C: PADDY
D: He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore.
N: Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
C: BRENDAN
D: You and Tommy are training together?
N: Paddy nods.
C: BRENDAN
D: Tommy Conlon.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now.
C: BRENDAN
D: I know what her name is.
C: PADDY
D: I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here.
C: BRENDAN
D: I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?
C: PADDY
D: That too.
N: Brendan looks at him. Considers.
C: BRENDAN
D: Did he say if he wants to see me?
C: PADDY
D: He doesn't say much. He's just not that happy kid he was.
C: BRENDAN
D: Wow, look at you. Mister inside man.
N: Paddy frowns.
C: BRENDAN
D: You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened. This is unbelievable. Now I know what you're really doing here.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: What's that?
C: BRENDAN
D: You came to gloat.
C: PADDY
D: I did not come to gloat. I came to get my son back.
C: BRENDAN
D: Well, there you go. You got your son back.
C: PADDY
D: I'm talking about you, Bren--
C: BRENDAN
D: You got your son back.
N: Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
C: BRENDAN
D: You know, part of the reason I stuck around was `cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself. But you didn't have any interest in training me. Tommy was the one.
E: CONT'D
C: PADDY
D: Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean, you know. I'm sorry.
C: BRENDAN
D: Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.
C: PADDY
D: You are my son.
C: BRENDAN
D: Am I?
C: PADDY
D: Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me.
C: BRENDAN
D: Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me.
C: PADDY
D: Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to FORGIVE--
C: BRENDAN
D: Goodnight, Pop.
N: Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess stand at the door. Paddy waves.
C: PADDY
D: My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
N: Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
C: ROSIE
D: Daddy, who is that?
C: BRENDAN
D: Just some nice old man.
N: Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone in the yard.
S: EXT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
N: Tommy, his hoodie drenched, jogs up the sidewalk and enters the gym.
S: INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS
N: Fenroy watches "MMA LIVE" on his computer as Tommy walks in the door and heads into the gym. ON COMPUTER SCREEN: JON ANIK AT THE MMA LIVE DESK. A PHOTO OF KOBA, A BAD, BALD RUSSIAN FIGHTER, IS ALSO ON THE SCREEN.
C: JON ANIK
D: Huge news breaking here at ESPN. Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta. Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on U.S. soil in his legendary career...
N: Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his attention away from Mad Dog.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got you into Sparta. Took some doing, but I made it happen.. Thank you and 10 percent is customary.
E: off no reaction from Tommy
N: Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips.
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Tommy pulls a crumpled PIECE OF PAPER out of a beat-up wallet and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall.
S: INT. PILAR FERNANDEZ'S HOUSE, EL PASO, TEXAS - SAME
N: More of a shack than a house. PILAR FERNANDEZ (20s), a pretty but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year- old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi desert.

N: Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
C: FRANK
D: You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
C: BRENDAN
D: It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do.

C: FRANK
D: That's what I'm afraid of.
C: BRENDAN
D: Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you.

D: You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us?
C: BRENDAN

E: INTO PHONE BEAT
N: Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm in. I'm going.
E: CONT'D
N: A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her hands on her hips.
C: TESS
D: Really? So that's your decision? You decided? `Cause I really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together.
N: Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that he's about to get laid into.
C: TESS
D: You told me you were gonna fight guys that watched too much UFC. I saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's the guy they're watching.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: It's a lot of money, Tess.
C: TESS
D: I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan. I told you that. We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money.
C: BRENDAN
D: You don't think I can do it.
C: TESS
D: I think you can get killed.
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm not gonna get killed.
C: TESS
D: Fine, you're not going to get killed. But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt? You're not gonna end up in the hospital? You're not gonna end up paralyzed? We'll have no prize money. No house. Payments for HOSPITAL BILLS--
C: BRENDAN
D: Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise?
N: No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
C: BRENDAN
D: So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this.
E: CONT'D
N: Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.
C: TESS
D: I'm not gonna watch you fight again. I'm not. I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
E: BEAT
N: Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard. Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.
C: CALLEN
D: Fourth of July weekend doesn't officially start until tomorrow...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY
N: Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is in town.
C: CALLEN
D: ...but fight fans are already descending on Atlantic City for the Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts, Sparta.
E: V.O.
N: BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The greatest show on earth has hit the shore.
S: EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane" Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red carpet swarming with FANS. In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd, and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.
C: CALLEN
D: J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you?
C: J.J. RILEY
D: Growing up, we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right? I wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is. That's why I put this together, that's what all these people are here to see, and come Saturday night, that's what we're gonna find out.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Thank you, J.J. And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here! The legend arriving to fight on U.S. soil for the very first time...
N: The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo, trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS. FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie premiere out there and Koba's the star.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME
N: As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments later, Brendan comes walking through the doors. As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make eye contact. They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each other today. Paddy is just as shocked. Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.
C: FRANK
D: Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me.
N: Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.
S: EXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - TWILIGHT
N: The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic City, and sinks into the sea.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
N: Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby Dick" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground. ON TV SCREEN: LOCAL NEW JERSEY NEWS ANCHOR MICHELLE MOONEY SPEAKS OVER IMAGES OF THE RED CARPET EVENT AND PRESS CONFERENCE.
C: MICHELLE MOONEY
D: ...the only fighter missing from the event was dark horse entry Tommy Riordan.
E: ON SCREEN
N: ON TV SCREEN: A PICTURE OF TOMMY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NEXT TO A PICTURE OF LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD. Paddy notices the picture of Tommy. Puts down the program and takes his headphones off. MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Recent revelations that Riordan was not only a United States Marine but a hero in the Iraq War, has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere. (MORE) MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's web testimony to Riordan, who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq, is spreading like wildfire throughout the media. Paddy stares at the screen intently.
C: PADDY
D: Tommy!
N: ON TV SCREEN: MARK BRADFORD PEERS INTO A HAND-HELD CAMERA IN IRAQ AND SPEAKS. HE FIGHT BACK TEARS.
C: BRADFORD
D: ...the bridge just crumbled. The Amtrack was upside down. Water was coming in from everywhere. The water pressure was too much. We couldn't get the back hatch open.
E: ON SCREEN
N: ON TV SCREEN: BRADFORD HAS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF.
C: BRADFORD
D: We were all drowning, man. It was a death trap.
E: ON SCREEN CONT'D
N: Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite and stares at the TV.
C: BRADFORD
D: I couldn't have had more than another minute. Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off, and there he was. Before I could get out and thank him, he was gone. He just vanished like a ghost.
E: ON SCREEN CONT'D
N: Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him and back at the TV before heading toward the door.
C: TOMMY
D: I'm takin' a walk.
N: ON TV SCREEN: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON BRADFORD'S FACE. HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO TOMMY.
C: BRADFORD
D: You saved my life, brother. Anybody seeing this at Sparta, anybody out in Pittsburgh, reach out to Tommy Riordan. Tell him Mark said thank you.
E: ON SCREEN
N: ON SCREEN: BACK TO THE NEWS STUDIO, AND THE PHOTO OF TOMMY.
C: MICHELLE MOONEY
D: Footage taken from a helmet camera on the ground captured the heroic incident...
E: ON SCREEN
N: ON SCREEN: THE GRAINY FOOTAGE SEEN EARLIER IN THE MARINE BARRACKS OF TOMMY AND THE SUBMERGED TANK. Then the phone RINGS. Paddy grabs it.
C: PADDY
D: Hello? Brendan.
E: INTO PHONE BEAT
S: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
N: Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle rockets trace through the night sky. In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS. Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each other warily.
C: BRENDAN
D: Been looking all over for you. How's it going?
C: TOMMY
D: It's going.
C: BRENDAN
D: I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.
C: TOMMY
D: I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
C: BRENDAN
D: You don't want to go sit down somewhere?
C: TOMMY
D: I'm good right here.
N: Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence. Finally Brendan cuts right to it.
C: BRENDAN
D: Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again?
C: TOMMY
D: You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
C: BRENDAN
D: She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife.
N: Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
C: BRENDAN
D: That's Tess. And that's Emily and Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
E: CONT'D handing Tommy the picture
N: Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.
C: TOMMY
D: Don't know `em.
C: BRENDAN
D: I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.
C: TOMMY
D: Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?
C: BRENDAN
D: Because that's my family.
C: TOMMY
D: And who are you exactly?
C: BRENDAN
D: I'm your brother, man.
C: TOMMY
D: You were in the Corps?
C: BRENDAN
D: What?
C: TOMMY
D: I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
C: BRENDAN
D: I wasn't in the Corps.
C: TOMMY
D: Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps.
N: With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the beach. His brother runs after him.
C: BRENDAN
D: Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know?
C: TOMMY
D: I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?
C: BRENDAN
D: She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing?
N: No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
C: BRENDAN
D: God, man, I don't understand this. You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop?
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.
C: BRENDAN
D: That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them.
N: Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
C: BRENDAN
D: But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom.
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: You forgave us?
E: TURNING AROUND
C: BRENDAN
D: Yeah.
C: TOMMY
D: I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones.
C: BRENDAN
D: I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
C: TOMMY
D: You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me.
N: The words hit Brendan hard.
C: TOMMY
D: Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!
C: TOMMY
D: You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit.
N: Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
C: TOMMY
D: Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?
E: CONT'D
N: Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity. Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say. Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.
S: EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
N: Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot.
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY
N: Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around. After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand up and head into the Principal's office.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: The kids walk in. Zito looks up and shakes his head.
C: JOE ZITO
D: You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right?
N: All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to something.
C: STEPHON
D: We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.
C: TITO
D: What do you say?
C: JOE ZITO
D: Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly? I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all.
E: BEAT
C: NASH
D: But everyone wants to see it.
C: KC
D: The gym's the only place that's big enough.
C: JOE ZITO
D: It's never gonna happen.
C: STEPHON
D: What if we get a petition?
C: TITO
D: Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it.
C: NASH
D: The power of democracy!
C: JOE ZITO
D: Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you.
N: Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected, leave the office and walk off down the hallway.
S: EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT
N: The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.
C: CALLEN
D: The roof is about to blow clean off Boardwalk Hall Arena! It might be Fourth of July weekend, but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans! This is Atlantic City! This is the War on the Shore! And this is what everyone has been waiting for!
E: V.O.
N: Enormous electronic BILLBOARDS flash outside of the giant seaside casinos. On one, Koba hangs off the side of a ferris wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a replication of the iconic "King Kong" movie scene.
C: CALLEN
D: Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet duking it out over a 24-hour period for the largest purse in Mixed Martial Arts history. In the town everyone knows from the game of Monopoly, we've got ourselves a winner-take-all affair. Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice, and take riiiiide on the Reading. Sparta. Is. Here!
E: V.O.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: Play by play announcer Sam Sheridan and color analyst Bryan Callen stand cageside. The arena is packed to capacity and buzzing with anticipation.
C: CALLEN
D: Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen.
C: CALLEN
D: It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation...
S: INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
N: Tommy lays on the ground near the showers, collecting his thoughts. As Paddy watches a TV monitor showing Callen and Sheridan, an OFFICIAL pokes his head into the locker room.
C: OFFICIAL
D: Five minutes, Paddy.
S: INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER
N: Fenroy and a group of FIGHTERS gather around a TV in the gym. A very fired up group.
C: SHERIDAN
D: It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived, because here comes Tommy Riordan.
E: V.O.
N: ON TV SCREEN: A FURIOUS TOMMY MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE CRUSH OF INSANE SPECTATORS, PADDY DUCKING ALONG AT HIS SIDE. LIGHTS RICOCHET CHAOTICALLY AROUND THE ARENA.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: As Tommy makes his way toward the cage and the strobe lights sweep over nearly 15,000 SCREAMING FANS, not one of them sitting.
C: CALLEN
D: Tommy Riordan's captured the media's attention, but the question still remains: who is this guy? And more importantly, can he compete in this talent pool? Can he win?
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew who he was, and I've gotta say the fact that I don't know is strange. In an internet age where there are no secrets, this guy is a complete mystery. I can't find out anything about him. Tommy Riordan is officially Google proof.
E: V.O.
N: Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.
C: CALLEN
D: You gotta love this guy, Sam. No walk out music, no sponsors, no interviews. He skipped out on the press conference. Wouldn't have his picture take for the program. He's breaking every rule!
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: The only reason that Tommy is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: But the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video, which is even more stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes video. Let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven't seen it, and I don't know anyone who hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process, and then walked away without claiming a medal. He ripped the door off a tank!
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero, I'm not taking anything away from the guy. He's a very, very tough guy, Bryan, but the tank don't hit back. We've seen YouTube sensations fail on the big stage before.
E: V.O.
N: Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone.
C: CALLEN
D: Sam. He ripped the door off a tank!
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Frank holds mitts for Brendan as a TV plays.
C: CALLEN
D: Tommy Riordan definitely has his hands full in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is nothing to scoff at.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Yeah, he's the real deal. Very tough guy. Very high caliber fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere, and I imagine he's going to disappear just as quickly.
E: V.O. MORE
C: SHERIDAN
D: Great story, but I think your boy is about to be exposed as a YouTube sensation.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: ON TV SCREEN: REFEREE JOSH ROSENTHAL (30s) GIVES INSTRUCTIONS TO TOMMY AND HIS OPPONENT, FRANCISCO BARBOSA (20s). THE MUSCULAR BRAZILIAN DOESN'T HAVE A TRACE OF FEAR ON HIS FACE.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
N: Tommy and Barbosa face to face as JOSH ROSENTHAL instructs.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
N: In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.
C: CALLEN
D: We're about to get the big answer to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real? And here we go!
E: V.O.
N: The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Barbosa's gonna be looking for a take down.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: Definitely gonna be looking for a take down.
E: V.O.
N: There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying, and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.
C: CALLEN
D: Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real!
E: V.O.
N: As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement.
C: CALLEN
D: And now he's walking out of the cage! He's leaving the cage! There goes another rule out the window!
E: V.O.
S: INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME
N: Fenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the ferocious knockout they've just witnessed.

S: INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
N: The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank and a nervous Brendan sit alone.
C: OFFICIAL
D: Show time.
N: On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.
C: FRANK
D: You can do this.
N: He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.
C: FRANK
D: I want to hear you say it.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDAN
D: I can do this.
C: FRANK
D: Then let's go do this.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: BUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand.
C: SHERIDAN
D: J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he basically had to rely on the word of Frank Campana.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: And he chose Brendan Conlon, which quite frankly is something I just don't understand.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena, where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck. Brendan notices the old man as he approaches.
C: PADDY
D: Go get `em, son.
N: Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression. As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.
C: CALLEN
D: I can understand coming out to no music, by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance?
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: This is Beethoven, Bryan. This is Ode to Joy.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: You want to talk about renaissance men, you gotta talk about Frank Campana. Very unorthodox trainer, and one of the best in the game. He's well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm, to remain patient, and to remain composed under pressure.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat.
C: CALLEN
D: Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. In fact, let me show you something.
N: Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH inside.
C: CALLEN
D: This is Brendan Conlon. He's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank.
E: CONT'D
N: Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.
C: SHERIDAN
D: C'mon, give the guy a break. At least we've seen him fight before. He was in the UFC. We remember him.
C: CALLEN
D: I remember him, too. I remember him being very unmemorable.
S: INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: A nervous Tess sits at the table, failing to concentrate on folding laundry. The TV in front of her is off, but she glances at it anyway. In front of her sits a CELL PHONE. She glances at it repeatedly.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Brendan stands in the corner as his opponent, ORLANDO "MIDNIGHT" LE climbs in, shoulders bulging and abs shredded.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Midnight Le getting ready to climb into the cage and go to work.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: When the brackets were announced, Midnight thought he'd be going up against Marco Santos. He's gotta be thrilled to be seeing Brendan Conlon standing across from him.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive Midnight Le. Frank smiles at him.
C: FRANK
D: You asked for it.
N: Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Brendan retired from fighting some years ago, he's actually a high school Physics teacher now, and Midnight had some fun with that at the press conference.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: He said he was gonna give the teacher a serious lesson, and that getting killed was no way to spend a summer vacation.
E: V.O.
N: Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the cage for instructions.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions, I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
N: The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell.
C: FRANK
D: Have some fun, baby.
N: At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and strong. He repeatedly KICKS Brendan in the leg and batters him with STRIKES. His power is overwhelming Brendan.
S: INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
N: Paddy stares at the TV monitor. ON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT PICKS UP BRENDAN AND BODY SLAMS HIM. Tommy lays on the rubdown table, his eyes closed. No interest in Brendan's fight.

N: Frank exhorts Brendan from cageside, telling him to relax, but it's no use. It's an unholy beating going in the cage.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Zito drinks a glass of Scotch. ON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT POUNDING ON BRENDAN.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Midnight is all over Brendan.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: This can't last much longer. This won't last much longer. The teacher just has no answers.
E: V.O.
N: Zito leans forward. He looks as if he's going to have a heart attack.
C: ZITO
D: C'mon, Brendan, get outta there!
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
N: Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps.
C: FRANK
D: Get out of there! Get out of there!
N: Brendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him. No use.
C: CALLEN
D: And now he's got the hooks in. 20 seconds left.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: The end is near. Can he make it to the end of the round is the question.
E: V.O.
N: Midnight squeezes for all it's worth as Frank screams at Brendan, imploring him not to tap.
C: CALLEN
D: 10 seconds left, and Brendan's face is turning purple. Conlon's whole world is about to go from day to night.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight Le, who slams the canvas in frustration. As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a smiling Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him!
N: Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: The frazzled Zito continues to root for Brendan. ON TV SCREEN: MORE OF THE SAME. MIDNIGHT ALL OVER BRENDAN.
S: INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
N: An excited Paddy watches Brendan on the monitor.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
N: Midnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of encouragement as the battle continues. Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the ground. The crowd is on its collective feet.
C: SHERIDAN
D: He's got a Kimura locked in.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: Are you kidding me?
E: V.O.
N: Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on how to finish the move.
C: CALLEN
D: Midnight is in big trouble!
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: I don't think he's got anywhere to go!
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: This isn't happening! This can't happen!
E: V.O.
N: Midnight TAPS and the crowd EXPLODES. Shock and mayhem throughout the arena.
C: SHERIDAN
D: It just did, Bryan.
C: CALLEN
D: Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight! I can't believe it!
E: V.O.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Principal Zito leaps off his couch, SCREAMING in celebration. ZITO'S WIFE (40s), drying dishes, pokes her head in the room as the Principal pumps his fist over and over.
C: ZITO
D: He tapped him out! He tapped him out! He did it! He did it! He did it!
N: ON TV SCREEN: BRENDAN AND FRANK EMBRACING. CHAOS IN THE RING AND MIDNIGHT ON THE GROUND IN UTTER DISBELIEF.
C: SHERIDAN
D: This is what makes Mixed Martial Arts so great. There's so many ways to lose. One tiny miscalculation at any time and that's it.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: Frank Campana embracing his man, Brendan Conlon. I don't think either one of them can believe what just happened.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
N: Frank and Brendan embrace. The arena is BUZZING. Midnight gets off the canvas, and Brendan approaches him and bows. The dejected Midnight bows in return.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Great show of sportsmanship from the teacher.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: That's a hallmark of Frank Campana's philosophy right there.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Midnight Le is shocked. He thought he had a free pass into the second round, but instead he's going home. He dominated the fight the entire way, but fell prey to a very technical finish.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke.
N: A jubilant Brendan raises his arms in victory. The crowd responds to the gutsy underdog.

C: CALLEN
D: Conlon beats Midnight!

E: V.O.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: At the sound of the BELL, Koba sprints across the ring and delivers a flying kick to the chest of his already retreating OPPONENT. He picks him up with incredible strength, then SLAMS him into the ground and pounds his brains in. The whole thing is over in under 10 seconds.
C: CALLEN
D: That was quick.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Wow. Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

S: EXT. BOARDWALK - DAWN
N: Dawn breaks over Atlantic City.
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME
N: A CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens. Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines. From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who doesn't acknowledge him.
C: PADDY
D: Can't sleep, huh?
N: Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.
C: PADDY
D: I know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but I'm proud of you. What you did for that kid in the tank? That was really something.
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown?

E: BEAT
C: TOMMY
D: What'd I do? I took off.
N: Paddy starts putting things together.

C: PADDY
D: What the hell happened over there, Tommy?
E: CONT'D
C: TOMMY
D: That is none of your business.

D: Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand.
C: TOMMY
D: Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
C: PADDY
D: I'm really trying here, Tommy.
C: TOMMY
D: You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.
N: Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
C: TOMMY
D: Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man.
E: CONT'D
N: Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with QUARTERS.
C: TOMMY
D: In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes?
E: CONT'D MORE
C: TOMMY
D: Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here. Get the fuck outta here!
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: Tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.
S: EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY
N: Fourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
N: Paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck, clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. "Moby Dick" plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off. LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen off the wagon. Hard.
C: PADDY
D: God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards!
N: He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to no audience.
C: PADDY
D: Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the ship! Please stop the ship! Somebody help `em!
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.
C: PADDY
D: Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!
E: CONT'D
N: Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The monster from the past.
C: PADDY
D: You stop the ship, you Godless sonofabitch!
E: CONT'D
N: There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue is heard coming from the earphones.
C: PADDY
D: Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship. For the love of God. We're lost.
E: CONT'D
N: The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.
C: PADDY
D: Please stop the ship.
E: CONT'D
N: Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries the whiskey bottle from his hand
C: PADDY
D: We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy. We'll never make it back.
E: CONT'D
N: Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.
C: PADDY
D: I always loved you. You know that, don't you Tommy? I always loved you. You and your brother. My two boys.
E: CONT'D MUMBLING
N: Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into the room. The end of a very long night.
S: EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT
N: A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the entire east coast has descended on AC. Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course. Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan holding a sling shot.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: The crowd at a fever pitch. Two sections full of MARINES in dress uniforms cheer insanely. So does an entire section of GIRLS wearing camouflage tank tops and holding up signs reading "TOMMY GIRLS." Everyone in the arena chants "Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!" A cult hero has been born.

C: CALLEN
D: Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it.
E: V.O.
N: The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes over his instructions with the two fighters.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
N: In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less intimidated.
C: MAD DOG
D: It's not gonna happen again.
N: Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
C: CALLEN
D: Mad Dog predicted an early knockout. Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Let's see what Tommy has to say about that.
E: V.O.
N: Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
C: CALLEN
D: And they are off!
E: V.O.
N: Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth. What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in restraint compared to what's happening in that cage.
C: CALLEN
D: Tommy tackles him and he's on top! He's raining blows!
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Someone has to stop this.
E: V.O.
N: Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside, Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal.
C: COLT BOYD
D: Stop it! Stop the fight!
N: It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.
C: CALLEN
D: That's the fastest knockout I think I've ever seen.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. He is not moving.
E: V.O.
N: Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass, and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed. Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a MEDIC tends to Mad Dog.
C: CALLEN
D: I'll tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key! Break out the yellow tape, Sam. Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER
N: "ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot. Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN, Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC, Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B. As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the crowd. They're completely on his side now.

D: He's getting a huge reception. I mean, this guy shocked everybody last night.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan stands in the corner. Frank leans over the railing of the cage and smiles at him.
C: FRANK
D: You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock.
N: Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.
C: FRANK
D: You alright with that?
E: CONT'D
N: Brendan looks at his wife. She smiles broadly. Mouths the words "I love you." Brendan grins. Kisses his glove and presses it against the cage. As he does, the lights go out inside the arena and ominous RUSSIAN MUSIC BLARES.
C: CALLEN
D: And here comes the great Russian Koba.
E: V.O.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Koba is so intimidating. His reputation is larger than life.
E: V.O.
N: The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his way toward the cage. Brendan watches. So does Frank. Tess takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear it.
C: FRANK
D: I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him.
N: Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.
C: FRANK
D: I'm proud of you brother. This is your cage.
E: CONT'D
N: Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at him like an exotic animal. Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold, dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold his gaze.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Alright, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight.
E: MORE
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.
E: CONT'D

D: Should I be nervous for Brendan? `Cause I am. I want to stop the fight before it even begins.
E: V.O.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
N: Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are astonishing.
C: CALLEN
D: Now the question is, how long can Brendan Conlon stay alive?
E: V.O.
N: Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.
C: CALLEN
D: Koba just pounding on Brendan Conlon! He's pounding on him like a side of beef!
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME
N: Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC buries her head in Nash's chest. ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS TAKING IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
S: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
N: Koba gets Brendan in a BEAR HUG, lifts him off the ground, carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of laundry, and body SLAMS him on his back.
C: CALLEN
D: Koba's got him in the air. Oh no!
E: V.O.
N: As Frank screams for Brendan to remain calm, a mortified Tess watches. Mercifully, the HORN sounds, and Brendan survives the round. He barely makes it back to his corner.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Frank Campana has to think seriously about stopping this.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: Seriously, Sam. How much abuse can one man take?
E: V.O.
N: The minutes passes in no time. It's time to go again.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Let's go to war!
N: Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: That one shook the entire building!
E: V.O.
N: As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the fight, the HORN sounds.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Everyone has gotta be concerned about Brendan Conlon's bravery getting him into trouble here.
E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: His bravery can get him killed, Sam. He's got nothing more to prove. He's already lasted two rounds against Koba, which is more than anyone else can say. You wonder what's keeping this guy up.
E: V.O.
N: Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool. Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone. He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.
C: FRANK
D: Sit down. Breathe. Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home.
E: grabbing Brendan's face
N: Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave, but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Let's go to war!
N: Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage, but the Russian resumes his supremacy.
C: CALLEN
D: Conlon somehow answering the bell for round three, but Koba's all over him again.
E: V.O.
N: Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg kicks. A decent punch or two.
C: SHERIDAN
D: Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There are signs of life in Brendan Conlon. He's starting to mix it up!

C: CALLEN
D: Koba's got him caught in an iron vice, squeezing for all it's worth and trying to choke the teacher out.
E: V.O.
N: Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back, freeing himself from the choke in the process.
C: CALLEN
D: He just launched Koba! Can you believe this? Conlon just shook off a guillotine!
E: V.O.
N: Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke.
C: CALLEN
D: Conlon's staying after him! He's squeezing him! The tables have turned, and the boy scout is squeezing the bear!

E: V.O.
C: CALLEN
D: This is a fight! We've got ourselves a fight!
E: V.O.
N: Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.

Brendan, the wind knocked out of him, is on his back, trying to protect himself from Tommy, who mounts him and starts blasting away with a BLUR of lefts and rights. The only thing that saves Brendan is the HORN. Which Tommy ignores, blasting his brother with a brutal CHEAP SHOT to the jaw well after the round had ended.
C: TESS
D: What was that!
C: FRANK
D: C'mon, Josh!
N: Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at Brendan. You want more? Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces in his corner like a caged animal.

Frank tries to instruct Brendan, but he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed. Tommy presses Brendan against the cage and does the same thing Koba did. He lifts him off the ground, carries him on a dead run, and body SLAMS him so hard the cage shakes. Then Tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again. The HORN sounds ending the round, but this time it's Brendan who pops up and pushes Tommy. Tommy shoves him back. Rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its approval.

C: FRANK
D: Switch! Switch!
N: Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba. Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.

D: He's doing it again! Conlon's doing it again! This is going to be over!

C: BRENDAN
D: Tap, Tommy!
N: Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact, he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.
C: BRENDAN
D: Tap!
E: CONT'D
N: The shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the round. Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence, and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.

N: Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him. Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water. Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his brother.
C: BRENDAN
D: I popped his shoulder.
C: FRANK
D: Relax, breathe.
C: BRENDAN
D: I heard it tear.
C: FRANK
D: You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder.

D: Josh!
N: Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
C: FRANK
D: Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him!
N: Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low. Brendan makes eye contact with him.

D: Shut up! C'mon.
C: BRENDAN
D: What are you that crazy?
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL

C: FRANK
D: Finish him! You finish him!
N: Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally, with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him, blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it. Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls Brendan away.
C: JOSH ROSENTHAL
D: Break! Break!
N: Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet. From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.

In fact, it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.

N: Brendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen. As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.

D: I love you, Tommy! I love you!

N: Tommy buries his head in Brendan's chest. A torrent of sobbing gushes from him, years of pain pouring out in heavy bursts. From the crowd, Paddy stares into the cage and watches as Brendan comforts his little brother, then helps him to his feet. Callen, Sheridan, and J.J. Riley make their way inside for the post-fight interview, cameras trailing behind them. With Frank continuing to run interference, Brendan pushes through the crush of people, arm around Tommy, and exits the cage. The crowd parts for Tommy and Brendan. Paddy watches them, a tear in his eye. He's overwhelmed by the sight of his two boys together again. As the noise from the arena fades, the brothers walk through the wild crowd and continue on through the tunnel, arm in arm... THE END
