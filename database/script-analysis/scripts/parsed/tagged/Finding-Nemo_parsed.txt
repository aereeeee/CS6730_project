N: | Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript. | | Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this | | isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing, | | may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been | | spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film | | where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which | | makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about | | 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line | | of equal signs (=). | | This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have | | any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit | | for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this | | transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement | | and the like. Enjoy. And remember: 'Fish are friends, not food'. |
C: MARLIN
D: Wow.
C: CORAL
D: Mmm.
C: MARLIN
D: Wow.
C: CORAL
D: Mmm-hmm.
C: MARLIN
D: Wow.
C: CORAL
D: Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.
C: MARLIN
D: So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver?
C: CORAL
D: My man delivered.
C: MARLIN
D: And it wasn't so easy.
C: CORAL
D: Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
C: MARLIN
D: You better believe they did--every single one of them.
C: CORAL
D: Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.
C: MARLIN
D: So, you do like it, don't you?
C: CORAL
D: No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?
C: MARLIN
D: Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by their bedroom window.
C: CORAL
D: Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, right. Right.
C: CORAL
D: Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.
C: MARLIN
D: You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.
C: CORAL
D: I like Nemo.
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.
C: CORAL
D: Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!
C: MARLIN
D: Yeah. What if they don't like me?
C: CORAL
D: Marlin.
C: MARLIN
D: No, really.
C: CORAL
D: There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.
C: CORAL
D: What?
C: MARLIN
D: You remember how we met?
C: CORAL
D: Well, I try not to.
C: MARLIN
D: Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'
C: CORAL
D: Marlin!
N: MARLIN 'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.
C: CORAL
D: Get away!
C: MARLIN
D: Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?
C: MARLIN
D: [gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside, you, right now.
C: MARLIN
D: No!
C: MARLIN
D: Coral! Coral?
C: MARLIN
D: Coral? Oh!
C: MARLIN
D: Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...Nemo.
C: NEMO
D: First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!
C: MARLIN
D: I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.
C: NEMO
D: Not you, dad. Me!
C: MARLIN
D: Okay...huh?
C: NEMO
D: Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!
C: MARLIN
D: All right, I'm up.
C: NEMO
D: Oh boy--whoa!
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo!
C: NEMO
D: First day of school!
C: MARLIN
D: [gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. All right, where's the break? You feel a break?
C: NEMO
D: No.
C: MARLIN
D: Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?
C: NEMO
D: No.
C: MARLIN
D: Are you woozy?
C: NEMO
D: No.
C: MARLIN
D: How many stripes do I have?
C: NEMO
D: I'm fine.
C: MARLIN
D: Answer the stripe question!
C: NEMO
D: Three.
C: MARLIN
D: No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh, you're okay. How's the lucky fin?
C: NEMO
D: Lucky.
C: MARLIN
D: Let's see.
C: MARLIN
D: Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years.
C: NEMO
D: Come on, dad. It's time for school.
C: MARLIN
D: Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.
C: NEMO
D: Ohh...
C: MARLIN
D: Do you want this anemone to sting you?
C: NEMO
D: Yes.
C: MARLIN
D: Brush.
C: NEMO
D: Okay, I'm done.
C: MARLIN
D: You missed a spot.
C: NEMO
D: Where?
C: MARLIN
D: There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!
C: MARLIN
D: All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?
C: NEMO
D: It's not safe.
C: MARLIN
D: That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times--
C: NEMO
D: Dad..
C: MARLIN
D: All right. Come on, boy.
C: NEMO
D: Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!
N: MARLIN I highly doubt that.
C: NEMO
D: Have you ever met a shark?
C: MARLIN
D: No, and I don't plan to.
C: NEMO
D: How old are sea turtles?
C: MARLIN
D: Sea turtles? I don't know.
C: NEMO
D: Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about a hundred years old!
C: MARLIN
D: Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin.
C: NEMO
D: Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
C: MARLIN
D: Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.
C: FISH KIDS
D: Bye, mom!
C: FISH MOM
D: I'll pick you up after school.
C: CRAB KID
D: Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!
C: MARLIN
D: Come on, we'll try over there.
C: MARLIN
D: Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?
C: BOB
D: Well, look who's out of the anemone.
C: MARLIN
D: Yes. Shocking, I know.
C: BOB
D: Marty, right?
C: MARLIN
D: Marlin.
C: BOB
D: Bob.
C: TED
D: Ted.
C: BILL
D: Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.
C: BOB/TED
D: Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.
C: MARLIN
D: Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.
C: BILL
D: Aw, come on, clownie.
C: TED
D: Yeah, do something funny.
C: BOB
D: Yeah!
C: MARLIN
D: All right, I know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking, so forget that I--
C: BOB
D: Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!
C: KIDS
D: Whoa!
C: MR. JOHANSSEN
D: All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?
C: NEMO
D: Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?
C: MARLIN
D: I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.
C: MARLIN
D: That's where I would play
C: PEARL
D: What's wrong with his fin?
C: TAD
D: He looks funny!
C: SHELDON
D: Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?
C: BOB
D: Be nice. It's his first time at school.
C: MARLIN
D: He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.
C: NEMO
D: Dad.
C: PEARL
D: See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.
C: SHELDON
D: I'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]
C: TAD
D: I'm obnoxious.
C: MR. RAY
D: [singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the open sea.
C: KIDS
D: Mr. Ray!
C: SHELDON
D: Come on, Nemo.
C: MARLIN
D: Whoa, you better stay with me.
C: MR. RAY
D: [singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.
C: MR. RAY
D: Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?
N: KIDS We're under here!
C: MR. RAY
D: Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.
C: NEMO
D: Dad, you can go now.
C: MR. RAY
D: Well, hello. Who is this?
C: NEMO
D: I'm Nemo.
C: MR. RAY
D: Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
C: NEMO
D: Okay.
C: MR. RAY
D: You live in what kind of home?
C: NEMO
D: An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--
C: MR. RAY
D: Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!
C: MARLIN
D: Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.
C: NEMO
D: Dad, it's time for you to go now.
C: MR. RAY
D: Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front. And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.
C: JIMMY
D: Aw, man!
C: MR. RAY
D: [singing]
C: MARLIN
D: Bye, Nemo!
C: NEMO
D: Bye, dad!
C: MARLIN
D: Bye, son! Be safe.
C: BOB
D: Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.
C: MARLIN
D: Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?
C: BILL
D: Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.
C: MARLIN
D: They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?
C: BOB
D: Hey, Marty. Calm down.
C: MARLIN
D: Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!
C: BOB
D: 'Pony boy'?
C: BILL
D: You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.
C: TED
D: Pity.
C: MR. RAY
D: [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species that live in thesea.
C: NEMO
D: Whoa.
C: MR. RAY
D: [singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Oh...!
C: MR. RAY
D: Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food with the rays of the sun...
C: MR. RAY
D: Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps] Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck. There are as many protein pairs contained in this...
C: TAD
D: Come on, let's go.
C: MR. RAY
D: Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three!
C: NEMO
D: Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.
C: TAD
D: Cool.
C: TAD
D: Saved your life!
C: PEARL
D: Aw, you guys made me ink.
C: NEMO
D: What's that?
C: TAD
D: I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a butt.
C: NEMO
D: Whoa.
C: PEARL
D: Wow. That's a pretty big butt.
C: SHELDON
D: Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!
C: SHELDON
D: Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.
C: PEARL
D: Okay. Beat that.
C: TAD
D: Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?
C: NEMO
D: Uh, my dad says it's not safe.
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo, no!
C: NEMO
D: Dad?
C: MARLIN
D: You were about to swim into open water!
C: NEMO
D: No, I wasn't go out--but dad!
C: MARLIN
D: It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--
C: PEARL
D: Sir, he wasn't gonna go.
C: TAD
D: Yeah, he was too afraid.
C: NEMO
D: No, I wasn't.
C: MARLIN
D: This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out there. You know you can't swim well.
C: NEMO
D: I can swim fine, dad, okay?
C: MARLIN
D: No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two.
C: NEMO
D: No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--
C: MARLIN
D: Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo!
C: NEMO
D: I hate you.
C: MR. RAY
D: There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem?
C: MARLIN
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.
C: MR. RAY
D: Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.
N: MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--
C: FISH KID
D: Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo--Nemo!
C: TAD
D: [whispering] He touched the butt.
C: MARLIN
D: You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...big--
C: NEMO
D: Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!
C: MARLIN
D: I'm coming, Nemo!
C: KIDS
D: Aaaah!
C: MR. RAY
D: Get under me, kids!
C: NEMO
D: Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!
C: MARLIN
D: Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!
C: DIVER
D: Whoa! Hold on.
C: MARLIN
D: Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!
C: MARLIN
D: Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!
C: DORY
D: Look out!
C: MARLIN
D: Waaaah!
C: MARLIN
D: Ooh, ooh...
C: DORY
D: Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?
C: MARLIN
D: He's gone, he's gone..
C: DORY
D: There, there. It's all right.
C: MARLIN
D: He's gone.
C: DORY
D: It'll be okay.
C: MARLIN
D: No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.
C: DORY
D: Hey, I've seen a boat.
C: MARLIN
D: You have?
C: DORY
D: It passed by not too long ago.
C: MARLIN
D: A white one?
C: DORY
D: Hi. I'm Dory.
C: MARLIN
D: Where!? Which way!?
C: DORY
D: Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!
N: MARLIN Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!
C: DORY
D: No problem.
C: MARLIN
D: Hey! Wait!
C: DORY
D: Will you quit it?
C: MARLIN
D: What?
C: DORY
D: I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?
C: MARLIN
D: Huh?
C: DORY
D: You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah, oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?
C: MARLIN
D: Wait a minute..
C: DORY
D: Stop following me, okay!?
C: MARLIN
D: What? You're showing me which way the boat went!
C: DORY
D: A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this way. Follow me!
C: MARLIN
D: Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going!
C: DORY
D: I did? Oh dear...
C: MARLIN
D: If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!
C: DORY
D: No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
C: MARLIN
D: Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!
C: DORY
D: No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?
C: MARLIN
D: Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]
C: BRUCE
D: Hello.
C: DORY
D: Well, hi!
C: BRUCE
D: Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late, eh?
C: MARLIN
D: Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.
C: BRUCE
D: Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?
N: DORY You mean like a party?
C: BRUCE
D: Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?
C: DORY
D: Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!
C: MARLIN
D: Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, come on, I insist.
C: MARLIN
D: O-okay..that's all that matters.
C: DORY
D: Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!
C: BRUCE
D: Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.
C: BRUCE
D: Anchor! Chum!
C: ANCHOR
D: There you are, Bruce, finally!
C: BRUCE
D: We got company.
C: ANCHOR
D: It's about time, mate.

C: DORY
D: Hey there!
C: BRUCE
D: How 'bout you, Chum?
C: CHUM
D: Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.
C: BRUCE
D: That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself to one of my friends.
C: CHUM
D: Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?
C: BRUCE
D: I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.
C: ANCHOR/CHUM
D: Hello, Bruce.
C: BRUCE
D: It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.
C: CHUM
D: You're an inspiration to all of us.
C: ANCHOR
D: Amen.

C: CHUM
D: Hey, that's incredible.
C: BRUCE
D: Good on 'ya, mate!
C: DORY
D: Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.
C: BRUCE
D: All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?
C: MARLIN
D: Me? I don't have a problem.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh. Okay..
C: BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
D: Denial.
C: BRUCE
D: Just start with your name.
C: MARLIN
D: Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--
C: CHUM
D: A clownfish? Really?!
C: BRUCE
D: Go on, tell us a joke!
C: CHUM
D: Ooh! I love jokes!
C: MARLIN
D: Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...
C: NEMO
D: Daddy!
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo!
C: CHUM
D: Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.
C: BRUCE
D: For a clownfish, he's not that funny.
C: MARLIN
D: No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.
C: DORY
D: Oh my, you poor fish.
C: CHUM
D: Humans. Think they own everything.
C: ANCHOR
D: Probably American.
C: BRUCE
D: Now there is a father looking for his little boy.
C: MARLIN
D: Ugh! What do these markings mean?
C: BRUCE
D: I never knew my father! [sobs]
C: CHUM
D: Aw, come here.
C: ANCHOR
D: Group hug.
C: CHUM
D: We're all mates here, mate.
C: MARLIN
D: I can't read human.
C: DORY
D: Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!
C: MARLIN
D: No, no, no, Dory!
C: DORY
D: Guys, guys!
C: MARLIN
D: No, Dory!
C: DORY
D: That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
C: DORY
D: Ow, ow, ow.
C: MARLIN
D: I'm so sorry.
C: DORY
D: You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?
C: MARLIN
D: Ohh...
C: DORY
D: Ow, ow, ow.
C: BRUCE
D: Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.
C: ANCHOR/CHUM
D: Intervention!
C: BRUCE
D: Just a bite!
C: ANCHOR
D: Hold it together, mate!
C: CHUM
D: Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!
C: BRUCE
D: FOOD!
C: MARLIN
D: Dory, look out!
C: BRUCE
D: I'm havin' fish tonight!
C: CHUM
D: Remember the steps, mate!
C: BRUCE
D: Just one bite!
C: BRUCE
D: G'day!
C: MARLIN/DORY

C: BRUCE
D: Arrrr!
C: MARLIN

C: MARLIN
D: There's gotta be a way out!
C: DORY
D: Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled just like the word 'escape'.

D: Let's go!
C: BRUCE

C: BARBARA
D: Okay.
C: DENTIST
D: Hello, little fella!
C: NEMO
D: Aah!
C: DENTIST
D: Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?
C: PATIENT

D: Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!
C: JACQUES
D: Bonjour.
C: NEMO
D: Aah!
C: BLOAT
D: Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.
C: DEB
D: Oh, he's scared to death.
C: NEMO
D: I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?
C: PEACH
D: Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.
C: NEMO
D: Pet store?
C: BLOAT
D: Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
C: GURGLE
D: Pet Palace.
C: BUBBLES
D: Fish-O-Rama.
C: DEB
D: Mail order.
C: PEACH
D: Ebay.
C: GURGLE
D: So which one is it?
C: NEMO
D: I'm from the ocean.
C: GURGLE
D: Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!
C: JACQUES
D: Oui.
C: GURGLE
D: Clean him!
C: JACQUES
D: Oui.
C: GURGLE

C: BUBBLES
D: Wow. The big blue. What's it like?
C: NEMO
D: Big...and blue?
C: BUBBLES
D: I knew it.
C: DEB
D: Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!
C: PEACH
D: [muffled] We got a live one!
C: BLOAT
D: Can't hear you, Peach.
C: PEACH
D: I said we got a live one.
C: GURGLE
D: Yes!
C: BLOAT
D: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
C: DEB
D: What do we got?
C: PEACH
D: Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.
C: PATIENT
D: Owwwwwwwww!
C: BLOAT
D: Rubber dam and clamp installed?
C: PEACH
D: Yep.
C: GURGLE
D: What did he use to open?
C: PEACH
D: Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.
C: DEB
D: I can't see, Flo.
C: PATIENT
D: You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!
C: PEACH
D: Now he's doing the Schilder technique.
C: BLOAT
D: Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.
C: GURGLE
D: That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.
C: BLOAT
D: It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.
C: GURGLE
D: No, no. K-Flex.
C: BLOAT
D: Hedstrom!
C: GURGLE
D: K-Flex!
C: BLOAT
D: Hedstro--! [inflates] There I go. A little help over here.
C: DEB
D: I'll go deflate him.
C: DENTIST
D: All right, go ahead and rinse.
C: GURGLE
D: Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.
C: PEACH
D: Hey, Nigel.
C: NIGEL
D: What did I miss? Am I late?
C: PEACH
D: Root canal and it's a doozy.
C: NIGEL
D: Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?
C: PEACH
D: Gator-Glidden drill.
C: NIGEL
D: He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus... hello.
C: NEMO
D: [gasps]
C: NIGEL
D: Who's this?
C: DEB
D: New guy. Ha ha ha!
C: GURGLE
D: The dentist took him off the reef.
C: NIGEL
D: An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. [gasps]
C: DENTIST
D: Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh, the picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up I'm going to see a man about a wallaby.
C: BLOAT
D: Oh, Darla.
C: NEMO
D: What? What's wrong with her?
C: GURGLE
D: She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.
C: BUBBLES
D: Poor Chuckles.
C: DEB
D: He was her present last year.
C: BLOAT
D: Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.
C: PEACH
D: She's a fish killer.
C: NEMO
D: I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!
C: GURGLE
D: Oh, he's stuck!
N: GILL Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him.
C: NEMO
D: Can you help me?
C: GILL
D: No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.
C: PEACH
D: Gill..
C: GILL
D: I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.
C: NEMO
D: I can't. I have a bad fin.
C: GILL
D: Never stopped me.
C: GILL
D: Just think about what you need to do.
C: BLOAT
D: Come on.
C: GILL
D: Perfect.
C: BUBBLES
D: Yay!
C: GURGLE
D: You did it!
C: DEB
D: Good squirming! Ha ha ha!
C: PEACH
D: Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.
C: GILL
D: Yeah.
C: PEACH
D: I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?
C: GILL
D: I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.
C: BLOAT
D: So kid, you got a name or what?
C: NEMO
D: Nemo. I'm Nemo.
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo. Nemo. [mutters]
C: DORY
D: Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...
C: MARLIN
D: Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!
C: DORY
D: Sea monkey has my money...
C: MARLIN
D: Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

C: DORY
D: Did you drop it?
C: MARLIN
D: You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.
C: DORY
D: Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?
C: MARLIN
D: I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.
C: DORY
D: [singing] Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory, no singing.
C: DORY
D: [singing] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim..
C: MARLIN
D: See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!
C: DORY
D: Sorry.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory, do you see anything?
C: DORY
D: Aaah! Something's got me!
C: MARLIN
D: That was me. I'm sorry.
C: DORY
D: [gasps] Who was that?
C: MARLIN
D: Who could it be? It's me!
C: DORY
D: Are..are you my conscience?
C: MARLIN
D: Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?
C: DORY
D: Hmm, can't complain.
C: MARLIN
D: Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?
C: DORY
D: I see..I see a light.
C: MARLIN
D: A light.
C: DORY
D: Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?
C: MARLIN
D: No, I see it too. What is it?
C: DORY
D: It's so pretty.

C: MARLIN
D: Read it!
C: DORY
D: I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. That's great, keep it right there.
C: MARLIN
D: Just read it!
C: DORY
D: Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh! The first line's 'P. Sherman'!
C: MARLIN
D: P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!
C: DORY
D: Okay, second line. '42'.
C: MARLIN
D: Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

C: MARLIN
D: Dory! What did the mask say?
C: DORY
D: 'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'. [gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it this time!
C: MARLIN
D: Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?
C: DORY
D: I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!
C: MARLIN/DORY
D: Aaah!
C: DORY
D: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!
C: JACQUES
D: Psst. Nemo.
C: NEMO
D: Mmmm...
C: JACQUES
D: Nemo.
C: NEMO
D: Huh?
C: JACQUES
D: Suivez-moi. Follow me.
C: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
D: [chanting] Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hahoo! Wahoo! Yahoo! Ho! Ha! Ho! Wahee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hoo!
C: GILL
D: State your name.
C: NEMO
D: Nemo.
C: GILL
D: Brother Bloat, proceed.
C: BLOAT
D: Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.
C: NEMO
D: Huh?
C: PEACH
D: We want you in our club, kid.
C: NEMO
D: Really?
C: BLOAT
D: If you are able to swim through..THE RING OF FIRE! [whispers to Jacques] Turn on the Ring of Fire! The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it--THE RING OF FIRE!
C: BUBBLES
D: Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!
C: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
D: [chanting]
C: PEACH
D: Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!
C: JACQUES
D: [wailing]
C: GILL
D: From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.
C: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
D: Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!
C: GILL
D: Welcome, brother Sharkbait!
C: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
D: Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!
C: GILL
D: Enough with the Sharkbait.
C: GURGLE
D: Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.
C: GILL
D: Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?
C: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
D: Agreed!
C: GILL
D: We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help him escape.
C: NEMO
D: Escape? Really?
C: GILL
D: We're all gonna escape!
C: GURGLE
D: Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.
C: DEB
D: Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.
C: BLOAT
D: Yeah. Why should this be any different?
C: GILL
D: 'Cause we've got him.
C: NEMO
D: Me?
C: GILL
D: You see that filter?
C: NEMO
D: Yeah?
C: GILL
D: You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?
C: BLOAT
D: Aye!
C: JACQUES
D: Aye!
C: DEB
D: Aye!
C: BUBBLES
D: Aye!
C: GURGLE
D: I think your nuts.
C: GILL/NEMO
D: [sighs]
C: GURGLE
D: No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.
C: GILL
D: He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?
C: NEMO
D: Let's do it.
C: DORY
D: I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...
C: MARLIN
D: Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs]
C: DORY
D: P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it--
C: MARLIN
D: Okay, all right.
C: DORY
D: Huh?
C: MARLIN
D: Here's the thing.
N: DORY Uh-huh.
C: MARLIN
D: Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.
C: DORY
D: Okay.
C: MARLIN
D: Y'know, alone.
C: DORY
D: Uh-huh.
C: MARLIN
D: Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you... with me.
C: DORY
D: Huh?
C: MARLIN
D: I don't wanna hurt your feelings..
C: DORY
D: You want me to leave?
C: MARLIN
D: Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.
C: DORY
D: You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]
C: MARLIN
D: No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?
C: DORY
D: Um, I don't remember. Were you?
C: MARLIN
D: No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?
C: DORY
D: Mm-mmm-mmmm.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.
C: DORY
D: Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.
C: DORY
D: Wait, wait, um..
C: MARLIN
D: It's a swordfish.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?
C: DORY
D: Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.
C: MARLIN
D: [coughs up answer]Lobster.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Saw that.
C: MARLIN
D: What?
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.
C: DORY
D: Clam!
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Close enough. [singing] Oh, it's a whale of a tale, I'll tell you lad, a whale of a tale.
C: DORY
D: Oh, they're good.
C: MARLIN
D: Will somebody please give me directions?
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: [impersonating Marlin] Will somebody please give me directions?
C: DORY
D: Ha ha ha ha ha!
C: MARLIN
D: I'm serious.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!
C: MARLIN
D: Thank you.
C: DORY
D: Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?
C: MARLIN
D: What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.
C: DORY
D: Boy, bet that's frustrating.
C: MARLIN
D: Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.
C: DORY
D: You're son Chico?
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo.
C: DORY
D: Right. Got it.
C: MARLIN
D: But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.
C: DORY
D: Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: What, is he bothering you again?
C: DORY
D: No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?
C: MOONFISH TED
D: Sure do.
C: DORY
D: Oh, hey! They know Sydney!
C: MARLIN
D: [gasps]
C: DORY
D: You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current, can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna put you right past Sydney.
C: MOONFISH SCHOOL
D: TA-DAA!
C: MARLIN
D: Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!
C: DORY
D: Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.
C: MARLIN
D: Well, listen fellas, thank you.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?
C: DORY
D: Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.
C: DORY
D: Yes.
C: MOONFISH LEADER
D: When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.
C: DORY
D: Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello! Okay, let's go.
C: MARLIN
D: Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.
C: DORY
D: Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through it, not over it.
C: MARLIN
D: Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.
C: DORY
D: I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.
C: MARLIN
D: And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.
C: DORY
D: Come on, trust me on this.
C: MARLIN
D: Trust you?
C: DORY
D: Yes, trust. It's what friends do.
C: MARLIN
D: Look! Something shiny!
N: DORY Where?
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.
C: DORY
D: Okay.
C: DORY
D: Boy, sure is clear up here.
C: MARLIN
D: Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.
C: DORY
D: Hey, little guy.
C: MARLIN
D: You wanted to go through the trench.
C: DORY
D: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk]---oww!
C: MARLIN
D: Dory! That's a jellyfish!
C: DORY
D: Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

C: DORY
D: Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
C: MARLIN
D: I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.
C: DORY
D: Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?
C: MARLIN
D: It did. It's just that..
C: DORY
D: Ow! Ow, oww!
C: MARLIN
D: ..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here.
C: DORY
D: Ow, ow! Oww!
C: MARLIN
D: It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?
C: DORY
D: Yeah.
C: MARLIN
D: That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.[gasps]
C: MARLIN/DORY
D: Aaaah!
C: MARLIN
D: Don't move! This is bad, Dory.
C: DORY
D: Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!
C: MARLIN
D: [gasps] Dory!
C: DORY
D: Boing-boing-boing! [singing] You can't catch me!
C: MARLIN
D: Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you, that's it!
C: DORY
D: Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.
C: DORY
D: A game?
C: MARLIN
D: A game.
C: DORY
D: A game?
C: MARLIN
D: Yes.

C: DORY
D: Okay!
C: MARLIN
D: Rules, rules, rules!
C: DORY
D: Okay!
C: MARLIN
D: You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.
C: DORY
D: Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!
C: MARLIN
D: W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!
C: DORY
D: Weeee!
C: MARLIN
D: Dory!
C: DORY
D: Gotta go faster if you wanna win!
C: MARLIN
D: [gasps] Dory!

C: MARLIN
D: Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!
C: DORY
D: Weeee!
C: MARLIN
D: So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful.
C: DORY
D: Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, I don't think so!
C: DORY
D: Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.
C: MARLIN
D: The question is, Dory, are you hungry?
C: DORY
D: Huh? Hungry?
C: MARLIN
D: Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Uggghhh!
C: DORY

C: GILL
D: You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?
C: NEMO
D: Yeah.
C: GILL
D: Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.
C: NEMO
D: He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.
C: GILL
D: Peach, any movement?
C: PEACH
D: He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.
C: GILL
D: Keep on him.
C: GILL
D: My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.
C: NEMO
D: Toilet?
C: GILL
D: All drains lead to the ocean, kid.
C: NEMO
D: Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?
C: GILL
D: Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.
C: BUBBLES
D: Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---
C: PEACH
D: Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.
C: GILL
D: That's your cue, Sharkbait.
C: BLOAT
D: You can do it, kid.
C: GILL
D: Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I'll talk you through the rest.
C: NEMO
D: Okay.
C: GILL
D: Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.
C: NEMO
D: [takes a deep breath]
C: GILL
D: Nicely done! Can you hear me?
C: NEMO
D: Yeah.
C: GILL
D: Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?
C: NEMO
D: Uh-huh.
C: GILL
D: Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.
C: NEMO
D: Aaah!
C: GILL
D: Careful, Sharkbait.
C: NEMO
D: I can't do it!
C: PEACH
D: Gill, this isn't a good idea.
C: GILL
D: He'll be fine. Try again.
C: NEMO
D: Okay.
C: GILL
D: That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.
C: NEMO
D: I got it! I got it!
C: PEACH
D: [sigh]
C: BLOAT
D: He did it!
C: GURGLE
D: Whew!
C: GILL
D: That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.
C: NEMO
D: Oh no! Gill! Gill!
C: GILL
D: Sharkbait!
C: BLOAT
D: Oh my gosh!
C: GILL
D: Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there!
C: BUBBLES
D: Help him!
C: GURGLE
D: What do we do!? What do we do!?
C: PEACH
D: Oh no!
C: GILL

C: GILL
D: Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!
C: NEMO
D: No! No!
C: GILL
D: Feed me more!
C: GURGLE
D: That's it!
C: GILL
D: Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!
C: NEMO
D: I got it!
C: GILL
D: Pull!
C: PEACH
D: Gill, don't make him go back in there.
C: GILL
D: No. We're done.
C: CRUSH
D: Dude.
C: MARLIN
D: Ooh...
C: CRUSH

C: MARLIN
D: Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes.
C: SQUIRT
D: You rock, dude.
C: MARLIN
D: Ow.
C: CRUSH
D: Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.
C: MARLIN
D: All by themselves?
C: CRUSH
D: Yeah.
C: MARLIN
D: But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?
C: CRUSH
D: Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.
C: DORY
D: Hey! Look, everybody!
C: SQUIRT
D: I know that dude. It's the Jellyman.
C: DORY
D: Well, go on, jump on him.
C: TURTLE KIDS
D: Turtle pile!
C: MARLIN
D: W-w-wai-wait--
N: TURTLE KID 1 Are you funny? TURTLE KID 2 Where's your shell?
C: MARLIN
D: Hold on, I need to breath--
N: TURTLE KID 3 Are you running away? TURTLE KID 4 Did you really cross the jellyfish forest? TURTLE KID 5 Did they sting you?
C: MARLIN
D: One at a time!
N: TURTLE KID 6 Mr. Fish, did you die?
C: DORY
D: Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.
C: SQUIRT
D: So where are you going?
C: MARLIN
D: Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.
C: TURTLE KIDS
D: [gasp]
C: DORY
D: No way.
C: SQUIRT
D: What happened?
C: MARLIN
D: No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.
C: TURTLE KIDS
D: Awww! Please?
C: SQUIRT
D: Pleeeease?
C: MARLIN
D: [sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.
C: DORY
D: Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.
C: MARLIN
D: And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them...
C: TURTLE KID
D: They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..
C: SMALL FISH
D: ..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!
C: BIG FISH
D: Golly, that's amazing!
C: SMALL FISH
D: And then dives thousands of..
C: LOBSTER
D: ..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing. How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..
C: SWORDFISH
D: ..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way...
C: DOLPHIN
D: So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian Current.
C: FEMALE BIRD
D: Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..
N: MALE BIRD 1 ..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at.. MALE BIRD 2 ..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it. MALE BIRD 3 That's one dedicated father if you ask me.
C: GULLS
D: Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
C: NIGEL
D: Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!
C: PELICAN
D: ..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.
C: NIGEL
D: Nemo?
C: PELICAN
D: He was taken off the reef by divers and this..
C: NIGEL
D: There, take it! You happy!
C: GULLS
D: Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
C: NIGEL
D: Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?
C: GULLS
D: Mine! Mine! Mine!
C: CRAB
D: Whooooooaaa..watcha!
C: GULL
D: Mine!
C: PELICAN
D: Last I heard, he's headin' towards the harbor.
C: NIGEL
D: Ho ho! Brilliant!
C: NEMO
D: [sighs]
C: DEB
D: Is he doing okay?
C: GURGLE
D: I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R..
C: NEMO
D: It's okay, I know who you're talking about.
C: NEMO
D: Gill? Gill?
C: GILL
D: Hey, Sharkbait.
C: NEMO
D: I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--
C: GILL
D: No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.
C: NIGEL
D: All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
C: DENTIST
D: What the!?
C: PATIENT
D: AAAAAAAAAH!!! Oooooh...
C: DENTIST
D: Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth. He he he he he! Huh, darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh, prime minister? He he he he!
C: NIGEL
D: Hey, hey. Psst!
C: PEACH
D: Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.
C: NIGEL
D: Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo! Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.
C: NEMO
D: What? What is it?
C: NIGEL
D: Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.
C: NEMO
D: My father? Really?
C: GILL
D: Really?
C: NIGEL
D: Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of--
C: NEMO
D: Sharks? That can't be him.
C: NIGEL
D: Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..
C: NEMO
D: Marlin?
C: NIGEL
D: That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.
C: NEMO
D: It's my dad! He took on a shark!
C: NIGEL
D: I heard he took on three.
C: DEB/BLOAT/GURGLE
D: Three!?
C: GILL
D: Three sharks!?
C: BLOAT
D: That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!
C: NIGEL
D: You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac.
C: NEMO
D: Really?
C: NIGEL
D: He's swimming and he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right now, to Sydney!
C: BLOAT
D: Wow! Ha ha ha!
C: DEB
D: Oh, what a good daddy!
C: GILL
D: He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.
C: GILL
D: [gasps]
C: GURGLE
D: He's swimming to the filter!
C: GILL
D: [gasps] Sharkbait!
C: BLOAT
D: Not again!
C: GILL
D: Sharkbait!
C: DEB
D: No!
C: GURGLE
D: You've got your whole life ahead of you!
C: BLOAT
D: Oh no!
C: GILL
D: We'll help you, kid!
C: BLOAT
D: Gotta get him out!
C: DEB
D: Gimme that thing!
C: DEB
D: Get him outta there!
C: GURGLE
D: Come on, kid! Grab the end!
C: ALL
D: [gasps]
C: DEB
D: Sharkbait!
C: BLOAT
D: Sharkbait! Are you okay!?
C: GURGLE
D: No!
C: GILL
D: Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?
C: NEMO
D: Yeah, I can hear you.
C: GILL
D: Sharkbait, you did it!
C: GURGLE
D: Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!
C: GILL
D: That took guts, kid.
N: GILL All right, gang. We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques!
C: JACQUES
D: Oui!
C: GILL
D: No cleaning.
C: JACQUES
D: I shall resist.
C: GILL
D: Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.
C: BLOAT
D: [belch]
C: GILL
D: Good work.
C: NEMO
D: Ha ha ha ha!
C: CRUSH
D: All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!
C: MARLIN
D: Where!? I don't see it!
C: DORY
D: Right there! I see it! I see it!
C: MARLIN
D: You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?
C: CRUSH
D: That's it, dude!
C: MARLIN
D: Of course it is.
C: CRUSH
D: Okay, first: find your exit buddy!
C: CRUSH
D: Do you have your exit buddy?
C: DORY
D: Yes!
C: CRUSH
D: Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!
C: SQUIRT
D: Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and punch it!
C: MARLIN
D: It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!
C: CRUSH
D: Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
C: MARLIN/DORY
D: Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!! Whoooooaaa!!!
C: DORY
D: Whoooo!
N: MARLIN Ha ha ha ha! That was..fun! Ha ha! I actually enjoyed that!
C: DORY
D: Hey, look! Turtles!
C: CRUSH
D: Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through to Sydney! No worries, man!
C: MARLIN
D: No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!
C: TURTLE KIDS
D: Bye! Bye, Jellyman!
C: CRUSH
D: You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?
C: SQUIRT
D: See you later, dudes!
C: DORY
D: Bye, everyone!
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?
C: CRUSH
D: Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!
C: MARLIN
D: Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.
C: DORY
D: Whoa. We goin' in there?
C: MARLIN
D: Yup.
C: DORY
D: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
C: MARLIN
D: Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.
C: DORY
D: [singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory?
C: MARLIN
D: Boy, this is taking a while.
C: DORY
D: Hey, how about we play a game?
C: MARLIN
D: Okay.
C: DORY
D: Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..
C: MARLIN
D: It's me.
C: DORY
D: Right. Okay..
C: DORY
D: ..orange, and uh, small..
C: MARLIN
D: It's me.
C: DORY
D: All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.
C: DORY
D: ..orange and small, and white stripes..
C: MARLIN
D: Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.
C: DORY
D: Okay, that's just scary.
C: MARLIN
D: W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!
C: DORY
D: Hey. Hey!
C: MARLIN
D: We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me! Wha--?
C: DORY
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.
C: MARLIN
D: Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!
C: DORY
D: Well, there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here. Let's see...okay, no one there. Uhh, nope. Nada. [gasps] There's somebody. Hey! Excuse--
C: MARLIN
D: Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones!
C: DORY
D: What is it with men and asking for directions?
C: MARLIN
D: Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card.
C: DORY
D: You wanna get outta here, don't you?
C: MARLIN
D: Of course, I do.
C: DORY
D: Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm? Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.
C: MARLIN
D: All right.
C: DORY
D: Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.
C: MARLIN
D: Ha..hello.
C: DORY
D: His son Bingo..
C: MARLIN
D: Nemo.
C: DORY
D: ..Nemo, was taken to, uh..
C: MARLIN
D: Sydney.
N: DORY Sydney. Yes. And it's really, really important that we get there as fast as we can. So can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.
C: DORY
D: Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale. MOOOOO-WEEEEEEE-NEEEEED...
C: MARLIN
D: Uh, Dory..what're you doing?
C: DORY
D: TOOOOOOO-FIIIIIIND...
C: MARLIN
D: What're you doing?
C: DORY
D: HIS-SOOOOOOOOOOOON...
C: MARLIN
D: Are you sure you speak whale?
C: DORY
D: CAN-YOOOOOOOUUU-GIIIIIIIIIVE-USSSS-DIRECTIOOOOOOOONS-TOOOOOOOOO...
C: MARLIN
D: Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.
C: DORY
D: COOOME-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!
C: MARLIN
D: He's not coming back. You offended him.
C: DORY
D: Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!
C: MARLIN
D: Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.
C: DORY
D: Maybe I should try humpback.
C: MARLIN
D: No, don't try humpback.
C: DORY
D: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO!!! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!!!
C: MARLIN
D: Okay, you actually sound sick.
C: DORY
D: Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!
C: MARLIN
D: Don't do that!
C: DORY
D: Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?
C: MARLIN
D: It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!
C: DORY
D: MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
C: MARLIN
D: It's just as well, he might be hungry.
C: DORY
D: Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.
N: KRILL Swim away!
C: DORY
D: Oh, look. Krill.
C: MARLIN
D: Move, Dory! Move!
C: DORY
D: Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!
C: GILL
D: Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!
C: JACQUES
D: I am ashamed.
C: PEACH
D: Hey, look. Scum angel.
C: GURGLE

D: Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor waitin' for you right now.
C: NEMO
D: Yeah.
C: MARLIN
D: Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!
C: DORY
D: Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!
C: MARLIN
D: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
C: DORY
D: Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!
C: MARLIN
D: Would you just stop it!?
C: DORY
D: Why? What's wrong?
C: MARLIN
D: We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?
C: DORY
D: A whale?
C: MARLIN
D: A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!
C: DORY
D: Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.
C: MARLIN
D: No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs]
C: DORY
D: Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?
C: DORY
D: There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.
C: MARLIN
D: No. No, it won't.
C: DORY
D: Sure it will, you'll see.
C: MARLIN
D: No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.
C: DORY
D: Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.
C: MARLIN
D: What?
C: DORY
D: Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo.
C: DORY
D: Hmm..
C: MARLIN
D: What's going on?
C: DORY
D: I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

C: MARLIN
D: Dory.
C: DORY
D: ..OOOOOOOOONNN?
C: DORY
D: I think he says we've stopped.
C: MARLIN
D: Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse. [gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down! It's-it's-it's going down!
C: DORY
D: Really? You sure about that?
C: MARLIN
D: Look, it's already half-empty!
C: DORY
D: Hmm..I'd say it's half full.
C: MARLIN
D: Stop that! It's half-empty!
C: DORY
D: Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float.
C: MARLIN
D: Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!? Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!
C: DORY
D: Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--
C: MARLIN
D: Stop talking to him--waaaah!
C: DORY

C: MARLIN
D: No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!
C: DORY
D: Yes, I can!
C: MARLIN
D: No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!
C: DORY
D: Okay.
C: MARLIN
D: Dory!
C: DORY
D: He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!
N: MARLIN How do you know!? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen!?
C: DORY
