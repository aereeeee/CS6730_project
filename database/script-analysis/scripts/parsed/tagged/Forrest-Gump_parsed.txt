S: EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)
N: A feather floats through the air. The falling feather. A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder. He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward the street. The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's mudsoaked shoe. The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case. Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items. Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase. Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all there. Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard. A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus continues on. A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a magazine as Forrest looks at her.

D: Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
N: He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.
C: FORREST
D: You want a chocolate?
N: The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her.
C: FORREST
D: I could eat about a million and a half of these. My momma always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."
N: Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes.
C: FORREST
D: Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that.
C: BLACK WOMAN
D: My feet hurt.
C: FORREST
D: Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been.
N: The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes.
C: FORREST
D: I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.

C: DOCTOR
D: How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've ever seen. But his back is as crooked as a politician.

C: FORREST
D: She said we was related to him in some way. And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name. Forrest Gump.

C: MRS. GUMP
D: Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.

C: MRS. GUMP
D: What does normal mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.
