T: FADE IN:
N: SCREEN TYPE: THIS IS A TRUE STORY
S: EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT. DAY
N: A burning white sun high in a clear blue sky, PAN DOWN TO: A rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat. A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on. CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES. A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm. The van stops next to the policeman.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning.
N: In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie, it is a matter of pride). A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.
S: EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
N: The van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio. Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch. ZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously. An airport baggage handler approaches the van.
C: HANDLER
D: Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.
C: PAUL
D: Thank you. He can get the beer.
E: to Zozo
C: ZOZO
D: Rutaganda's place?
E: suddenly worried
C: PAUL
D: What's wrong?
C: ZOZO
D: Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.

S: EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
N: The white van, marked "THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES," whips its way through Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets. ZXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY Zozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic.
C: ZOZO
D: What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
C: PAUL
D: It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
C: ZOZO
D: That is why they call it coach?
C: PAUL
D: Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
C: ZOZO
D: You have taken business class?
E: impressed
C: PAUL
D: Many times.
N: Suddenly, Zozo slows. Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts. They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia. (Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road, obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox.
C: PAUL
D: Turn off.
E: CONT'D
N: Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.
C: ZOZO
D: There is nowhere to turn, sir. As the van approaches,
C: PAUL
D: Slow down.
N: The van pulls up beside the Militia.
C: PAUL
D: Boys, do you know the way to Mr. Rutagunda's warehouse?
E: CONT'D
N: Some Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful. MILITIA MAN #1 It is one more mile on this road. Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.
C: PAUL
D: This is thirsty work, let me treat you to some beers.
N: As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved.
S: INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
N: At his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso. Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer. George holds out his massive shirt.
C: GEORGE
D: You will join us at the rally today?
N: Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.
C: PAUL
D: I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
C: GEORGE
D: Politics is power, Paul. And money.
N: Paul studies his watch.
C: PAUL
D: Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
C: GEORGE
D: Business is good at the hotel?
C: PAUL
D: Very good.
C: GEORGE
D: I am always glad to see you Paul.
N: George leads Paul out into the warehouse. As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.
C: GEORGE
D: Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
E: CONT'D
C: DRIVER
D: But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...
C: GEORGE
D: Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch. I won't charge extra.
E: to Paul
C: PAUL
D: Thank you.
N: The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds of them, spill out. An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.
C: GEORGE
D: A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
C: PAUL
D: At least.
N: Off Zozo terrified.

Line after line, waves all performing the INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears, wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power." A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd. Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.
C: PAUL
D: Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
C: ZOZO
D: Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
N: The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George gave him, peels off a few dollars.

E: CONT'D
C: BIK
D: Cockroaches?
E: O.S.
N: Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.
C: BIK
D: Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul? A sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to disappear inside.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
C: BIK
D: That's what I came to talk to you about.
C: PAUL
D: Excuse me?

C: PAUL
D: Hello, Anais. She laughs.
C: CARINE
D: I am Carine.
C: PAUL
D: You are not Anais?
C: ANAIS
D: I am Anais.
C: PAUL
D: Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a present for Anais.
N: Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine. Anais jumps up and down.
C: ANAIS

S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
N: Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car. They say good night to their guests. Anais and Carine sleep in the car. Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. Just then Roger emerges from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.

C: PAUL
D: Where?

D: On the street.
N: Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside. Thomas and Fedens grab the sleeping twins from their car. Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap between the gate hinge and the gate post.
S: EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
N: HE SEES: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around jeeps, they whisper and point. It's a raid. Now they move rushing out of view. The sounds of SPLINTERING WOOD, GLASS BREAKING, CHILDREN'S CRIES, WOMEN SCREAMING. Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's. It's Tatiana.
C: TATIANA
D: What is it?
N: She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the street. He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.
C: TATIANA
D: Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want Victor?
E: CONT'D
N: They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to die. It's a horror.
C: TATIANA
D: Do something.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: What?
C: TATIANA
D: Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
C: PAUL
D: Please, be quiet.
N: Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.
C: TATIANA
D: I'm going to talk to them.
N: Paul grabs her.
C: PAUL
D: No.
C: TATIANA
D: We must do something.
N: Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.
C: PAUL
D: What would you have us do? Argue with these madmen? We cannot interfere.
S: INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
N: Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears.
C: PAUL
D: You better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets.
N: Tatiana hides her anger.
C: TATIANA
D: I'll fix a bed.
S: INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
N: Paul lies in bed unable to sleep. The clock reads 3:00 am.
C: TATIANA
D: Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
C: PAUL
D: I couldn't help.
C: TATIANA
D: You could have asked for a favor.
C: PAUL
D: No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? All day long I work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon. Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger.
C: TATIANA
D: Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
C: PAUL
D: He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
C: TATIANA
D: They do not have your connections.
C: PAUL
D: Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
N: His turn away indicates the discussion is over.
S: EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING
N: Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house. SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994. An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie. The General gives an I'll see you soon wave.
S: EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
N: The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps, foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors. Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload.
C: PAUL
D: Welcome, gentlemen.

N: The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset.
C: GLORIA
D: We reserved five rooms not two
C: GREGOIRE
D: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here in the computer.
N: Jock sees Paul.
C: JOCK
D: Paul, how the hell are ya'?

C: JOCK
D: They moved you from the Diplomat?
C: PAUL
D: Promoted. House Manager.
C: JOCK
D: Good for you.
N: (moves closer) We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but... Paul moves behind the desk.
C: PAUL
D: Let me check.
N: He punches into the computer.
C: PAUL
D: Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of BBC Gregoire.
N: Close on the computer: It clearly states BBC - two rooms. Gregoire looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger. Of course, the BBC, five rooms. (lies) They are being prepared as we speak. I have ordered fresh flowers and complimentary champagne. Gloria picks up her bag.
C: GLORIA
D: Great, I really need a shower.
C: PAUL
D: Just give me a moment to get your keys.
N: Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter Benedict hovering at the door.
C: PAUL
D: Excuse me for one second.
E: CONT'D to Gloria
N: Paul hurries over to Benedict.
C: PAUL
D: Benedict, you should meet the BBC people. They could use your expertise.
E: CONT'D
N: Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby.
C: PAUL
D: Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here any moment. The BBC should talk to him.
E: CONT'D whisper
N: They join the BBC team.
C: PAUL
D: Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of our best journalists. He covers all the big stories. I thought you should meet.
E: CONT'D
N: Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm.
C: GLORIA
D: Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria Fleming. BBC.
N: Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure.
C: GREGOIRE
D: There are no more rooms.
C: PAUL
D: Give me the phone.
N: Gregoire hands it over. Paul dials.
C: PAUL
D: Madame Denver. I have very good news. I have a present for you, in return for the cancellation of your gorilla expedition I have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no extra charge. A luxury coach will leave in one hour. I'll send maids up to help you all pack. You're welcome.
E: CONT'D
N: Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire.

C: GLORIA
D: There are rumors, General, that your army, the Hutu army, consider these peace accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Nonsense. At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces.
E: laughs
C: GLORIA
D: Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing. Thank you for coming to Rwanda. . You will see what a beautiful country this is.
E: on the move
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
N: Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his hand out. Gregoire hands him keys. Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal. He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity. He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'. He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.
C: PAUL
D: Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake. It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa.
C: OB
D: Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there was famine in Africa.
C: PAUL
D: Exactly, we can't have our guests starving. What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States?
N: Gen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty briefcase.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Keep that cockroach Benedict away from me.
N: As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check, hands her the briefcase.
C: PAUL
D: Same as last time.
N: She nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out keys, greets each.

C: PAUL
D: I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
C: JOCK
D: Can we phone them in, Paul?
C: PAUL
D: I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. Ah, Zozo.
N: Paul calls Zozo over.
C: PAUL
D: You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat?
E: CONT'D

C: JOCK
D: Zozo! The very man!
N: The Scot and Zozo greet, then hurry off.

C: COLONEL OLIVER

N: The room as one raise their glasses. CLOSE ON: Paul as he nods to a member of the tribal band on the small stage. Then, African drummers hammer out a fast uplifting beat as the full troupe of ceremonial dancers skip into the room in celebration.
S: INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY
N: Paul checks out the banques. They appear empty, then a voice.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Paul, join us.
N: It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone. Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Have a drink.
N: He pours. George points his glass toward the Europeans.
C: GEORGE
D: Look at them, they want to see the tribes dance to their tune. Here is our dance.
N: Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the Hutu Militia War Dance.
C: GEORGE
D: Come on, Paul. Show them our dance.
E: CONT'D
N: Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then appears to stumble and shoulder bumps the big man. George falls into his chair.
C: PAUL
D: Forgive me, George, my step was off.
N: Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:
C: GEORGE
D: To our president. May he find peace.
N: As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu smiles at some insider joke.

D: My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we should get out now, that soon it will be very bad.
N: Paul stifles his anger.
C: PAUL
D: Give me this man's name.
C: THOMAS
D: His name is Naramaranga, but please, Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is a friend, he likes me. He told me there is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees." When they hear the signal, the militia are to go to war.
C: FEDENS
D: Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You are Hutu, you will be safe.
C: PAUL
D: Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks after his family. If there were danger I would be the first to leave?
N: BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the city. Fedens jumps.
C: FEDENS
D: What was that?
C: PAUL
D: Calm yourself, it is fireworks to celebrate the peace.
C: THOMAS
D: Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you my car. You will sell it for me and get a fair price. We will go to Tanzania until there is real peace.
C: ZOZO
D: Excuse me, Paul, you have a call.
N: Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone.
C: PAUL
D: ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I know but I want them to calm down.

C: PAUL
D: Call when you get home. And don't worry, Thomas. Good night.
S: INT. PAUL'S CAR. NIGHT
N: Paul's at the wheel, driving. A thick mist. Barely a car on the road. Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.
S: EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT
N: Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered; gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key. Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.
S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
N: Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark. His headlights sweep across his pitch-black house. UT TO: The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house. Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a flashlight, heads for the front door.
S: INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
N: The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch, nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating: magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys in a basket.
S: INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
N: Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one of the bedrooms.
S: INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT
N: Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the door. Nothing. He pushes it in.
S: INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
N: Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates: Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back. THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light. The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.
C: PAUL
D: Pealiss!
N: From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
C: TATIANA
D: Paul!
N: Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
C: PAUL
D: Jean Baptiste!
C: JEAN BAPTISTE
D: Our house has been burned.
C: PAUL
D: What is going on?
C: TATIANA
D: The president has been murdered.
C: PAUL
D: Murdered! By whom?
C: ODETTE
D: The radio says Tutsi rebels.
C: PAUL
D: Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace?
N: Tatiana pulls Paul aside.
C: TATIANA
D: Where are Thomas and Fedens?
C: PAUL
D: I sent them home. Go and call them.
C: TATIANA
D: I tried already. The phones do not work.
N: Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: Our great president is murdered, by the Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then they killed him. We must cleanse this country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must clear the brush. Clear the brush of all cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
N: The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. Everyone jumps, children whimper. Paul is shocked but tries to pull things together.
C: PAUL
D: Come on, everyone out of this room, find a seat in the living room.
N: He holds the door open, they file out, frightened. Tatiana is last, he stops her, steps back in, closes the door.
C: PAUL
D: Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
E: CONT'D in hushed anger
C: TATIANA
D: They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
C: PAUL
D: Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
C: TATIANA
D: Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
C: PAUL
D: They know you are Tutsi!
N: The door knocks. Paul gets up, angry.
C: TATIANA
D: Please, Paul, 'til first light.
C: PAUL
D: Dawn. Then they go.
N: Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest daughter.
C: ODETTE
D: Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that Roger has gone.
N: Tatiana comes over instantly, worried.
C: TATIANA
D: Gone where? Tell me, Danielle. Their daughter Danielle answers.
C: DANIELLE
D: Next door, mama. He was afraid for his friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
S: EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT
N: Roger crawls between the shrubs. He hears ANGRY VOICES. He peers through the long grass. Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a length of chain CLANGING on the ground.
S: EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
N: Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her. Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.
C: PAUL
D: Shhhhh.
N: SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.
S: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT
N: Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate. Engines rev. Roger crawls from the bushes. Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle. Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR!
S: EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
N: Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate. Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he pulls it back, clambers underneath it. Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry.
S: EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT
N: Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel. Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING. He moves toward the sound. Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes. He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles.
C: PAUL
D: Ssshh! Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house.
S: INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
N: Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down. Tatiana is beside them.
C: TATIANA
D: Roger!
N: Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
C: TATIANA
D: Oh, my God!
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Where are you hurt, son?
N: oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.
C: ODETTE
D: Get his clothes off.
N: Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger has no injuries.
C: PAUL
D: What happened, son? Where did you get this blood?
N: But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry.
C: ODETTE
D: He's not injured.
N: His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them.
C: PAUL
D: Leave us, give us some space.
N: He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.
C: PAUL
D: The neighbors must go at dawn.
E: CONT'D to Tatiana
N: Tatiana hugs her son.
S: EXT. KIGALI. DAWN
N: The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a grenade explosion, echoes. The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun rips the air.
S: INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN
N: PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk.
C: TATIANA
D: Will you take a little milk?
N: Nothing.
C: PAUL
D: Let him sleep.
N: The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.
C: OLD GUARD
D: Mr. Paul.
E: O.S.
C: PAUL
D: It is time for the neighbors to leave.
E: to Tatiana
N: He heads for the door.
S: INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN
N: Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the men wait nervously.
C: JEAN BAPTISTE
D: It is true.
N: He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.)
C: GLORIA THE REPORTER
D: The Hutu president's plane was struck by a ground-to-air missile as he returned from signing the peace accord with the Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors. The Hutu government has already blamed the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied the accusation. Already there are reports of reprisal killings on the streets.
E: O.S.
N: As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window where she's been sitting.
C: WOMEN
D: They are here.
E: O.S.
N: Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees: A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another up beside him. anic in the room now. Paul turns.
C: PAUL
D: Shut up!
N: PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols.
C: TATIANA
D: What is it, Paul.
E: O.S.
C: PAUL
D: Stay with the children.
N: PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open. Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his garden. The soldiers jump out. INSIDE THE ROOM: Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms. Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door. The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in. They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised, SHOUTS.
C: SOLDIERS
D: Out, get out now!
N: Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.
C: PAUL
D: Who is in charge?
N: A Captain is at the door.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Who are you?
C: PAUL
D: I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We are looking for you.
N: He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside.
S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN

C: PAUL
D: What is this about?
C: CAPTAIN
D: Let me see your identity card.
N: Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain. CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU. The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.
C: CAPTAIN
D: You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
C: CAPTAIN
D: You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
C: PAUL

N: The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly:
C: PAUL
D: I used to work at the Diplomat.
E: CONT'D
C: CAPTAIN
D: Do you know how to open the safe there? Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
E: Paul nods
C: PAUL
D: Of course.
N: Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see what is going on.
C: PAUL
D: Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
E: CONT'D
C: CAPTAIN
D: Where is your family?

D: All of them! I cannot take them.
C: TATIANA
D: No, no, good Captain, you do not have to. We have the car and our van.
N: She points to the Mille Collines van. he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent message. He listens. Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second, they are all clambering in.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Let's go.
N: Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed together on the front bench. The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the street. The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.
S: INT. VAN TRAVELING - DAY
N: Paul looks back as they speed off down the street. Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway. As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push a stove on a child's skateboard. TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head.
S: EXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY
N: The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes, nailed clubs and spears as they dance. FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in terror, waiting for the windows to give way. In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
C: PAUL
D: Don't look.
E: to Tatiana
S: EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY
N: The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul, bursts into waves of joy.

N: Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.

N: Paul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow. He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten the number. The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises.
C: PAUL
D: Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate, and maybe a few beers in the fridge. Don't let them go to waste.
N: The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge. Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens. He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal. He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over the beer and chocolates in the fridge. s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.
C: PAUL
D: I've got them.

D: Traitor!
N: Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet. The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the cards in Paul's face.
C: CAPTAIN
D: They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Let me explain.
N: He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers, shoves it into Paul's hand.

A kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as Close on Paul's face, as the music plays. His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around. The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears.

C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: Satellites?
C: PAUL
D: Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
C: ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: And what will they do with these satellites?
C: PAUL
D: The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: The high command? Our high command?
C: PAUL
D: 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. I thought I'd better tell you.
E: a beat
N: The General looks again to the sky then.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders `we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.' What do you think would have happened? No different.

D: Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: The police are very busy.
C: PAUL
D: I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
N: Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: He did.
C: PAUL
D: "Well rewarded" Those were his words.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
C: PAUL
D: The front gate would be best, General. They could check all guests.
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: I will see what I can do.
C: PAUL
D: I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
C: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
C: PAUL

N: Paul nods over toward Gregoire.
C: ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
D: He is staff?
N: he General gets up. Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.

D: Yes.
N: A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
C: BANKER
D: You have no right to charge us rent.
C: PAUL
D: Why not?
C: BANKER
D: This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery.
C: ODETTE
D: That is not true.
N: Another accuser speaks up.

D: You are most certainly not coming with me. You will get me killed.
E: CONT'D laughs
C: JEAN BAPTISTE
D: You can't go to that place, they know what you are doing here.
C: PAUL
D: George will not hurt me, I am too profitable to him.
C: ODETTE

N: Paul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out.

C: HUTU SOLDIER
D: Get out, or I'll shoot you.
N: Paul rushes to the stairs. More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia). AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling to get down. AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there, including Xavier who huddles in a corner.
C: PAUL
D: Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?

C: PAUL
D: TATIANA!

INSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time. INSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia. TO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the bed. INTO THE BATHROOM - empty. He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining hotel room is slightly open. INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER. FROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious. IN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain.

PAUL SEES: a great mass of Hutus fill the road: Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms. No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them, fleeing the advancing of the rebel army. A crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.
C: COLONEL OLIVER
D: Don't stop. Push through.
N: The driver reluctantly speeds up. A break in the mass of Hutu refugees. Then GUN FIRE ahead. Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's children, some of the women. Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the road. They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles. There's more gunfire behind. The Militia are almost upon them now. Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn.
C: COLONEL OLIVER
D: Keep going.
E: CONT'D
N: The Militia are at the truck. But they run STRAIGHT PAST! As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and red and blue headbands) burst from the brush. Pursuing, careful, professional.
C: PAUL
D: It's the rebels.
N: The crying stops. Silent disbelief.
C: PAUL
D: We've made it!
E: CONT'D
N: Cheering breaks out. Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria break into cries of joy. A rebel soldier waves his AK 47 in the air.
S: EXT. KIGALI SOCCER STADIUM. DAY
N: The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed together. Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. They hug, cry, an outpouring of relief. Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds. She rushes over.
C: TATIANA
D: Have you seen my sister Fedens?
N: Heads shak `no'. Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the crowds.
C: TATIANA
