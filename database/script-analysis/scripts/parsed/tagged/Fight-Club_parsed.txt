M: People were always asking me, did I
M: know Tyler Durden.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT
N: TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH. Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap. They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort of way. Tyler looks at his watch.
C: TYLER
D: One minute. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
E: looking out window
C: JACK
D: ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
C: JACK
D: With a gun barrel between your teeth, you only speak in vowels.
E: V.O.
N: Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.
C: JACK
D: I can't think of anything.
E: still distorted
C: JACK
D: With my tongue, I can feel the rifling in the barrel. For a second, I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wondered how clean this gun is.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler checks his watch.
C: TYLER
D: It's getting exciting now.
C: JACK
D: That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
E: V.O.
N: Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.
C: JACK
D: We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Look what we've accomplised. Thirty seconds.
E: checks watch
C: JACK
D: Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
E: V.O.
N: PULL BACK from Jack's face. It's pressed against TWO LARGE BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man. Jack is engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace. Bob weeps openly.
C: JACK
D: Bob had bitch tits.
E: V.O.
N: PULL BACK to wide on...
S: INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones. Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."
C: JACK
D: This was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
E: V.O.
C: BOB
D: We're still men.
C: JACK
D: Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
C: JACK
D: Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
E: V.O.
C: BOB
D: They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
N: Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.
C: BOB
D: Okay. You cry now.
N: Jack looks at Bob.
C: JACK
D: Wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
E: V.O.

N: Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.
C: JACK

S: INT. COPY ROOM - DAY
N: Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine. His Starbucks cup sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.
C: JACK
D: With insomnia, nothing is real. Everything is far away. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy.
E: V.O.
N: Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping. Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME
N: Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.
C: JACK
D: When deep space exploration ramps up, it will be corporations that name everything. The IBM Stellar Sphere. The Philip Morris Galaxy. Planet Starbucks.
E: V.O.
N: Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.
C: BOSS
D: I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week. We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
C: JACK
D: It must've been Tuesday. he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
E: listless management speak
C: BOSS
D: You need to make these your primary "action items."
C: JACK
D: He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
E: V.O.
C: BOSS
D: Here are your flight coupons. Call me from the road if there are any snags. Your itinerary...
N: Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.
S: INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips through an IKEA catalog. There's a stack of old Playboy magazines and other catalogs nearby.
C: JACK
D: Like everyone else, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: Yes. I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari slip covers.
E: into phone
N: Jack drops the open catalog on the floor. MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...
C: JACK
D: If I saw something like clever coffee table sin the shape of a yin and yang, I had to have it.
E: V.O.
N: PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...
C: JACK
D: Like the Johanneshov armchair in the Strinne green stripe pattern...
E: V.O.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN
N: The armchair APPEARS. PAN OVER next to armchair...
C: JACK
D: Or the Rislampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.
E: V.O.
N: The lamps APPEAR. PAN OVER to wall...
C: JACK
D: Even the Vild hall clock of galvanized steel, resting on the Klipsk shelving unit.
E: V.O.
N: The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.
C: JACK
D: I would flip through catalogs and wonder, "What kind of dining set defines me as a person?" We used to read pornography. Now it was the Horchow Collection.
E: V.O.
N: A dining room set APPEARS. Jack, the cordless phone still glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.
C: JACK
D: No, I don't want Cobalt. Oh, that sounds nice. Apricot.
N: Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.
C: JACK
D: I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of wherever.
E: V.O.
N: He rummages through the refrigerator. It's practically empty. Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses a butter knife to eat it.
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who studies him with bemusement.
C: INTERN
D: No, you can't die of insomnia.
C: JACK
D: Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
C: INTERN
D: You need to lighten up.
C: JACK
D: Can't you give me something?
C: JACK
D: Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
E: V.O.
C: INTERN
D: You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
E: overlapping w/ above
N: The Intern ushes Jack to the door. They step into the...
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.
C: JACK
D: I'm in pain.
C: INTERN
D: You want to see pain? Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That's pain.
E: facetious
N: The Intern moves into the other room. Jack stares after him.
S: EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Jack heads for the front door.
S: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all listening to a group member speak at a lectern. The SPEAKER has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.
C: SPEAKER
D: I... wanted three kids. Two boys and a girl. Mindy wanted two girls and one boy. We never could agree on anything.
N: The Speaker cracks a sad smile. Some men chuckle, happy to lighten the mood.
C: SPEAKER
D: Well, she had her first child a month ago, a girl, with her new husband... And, Thank God. I'm glad for her, because she deserves...
N: The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY. Jack watches. A couple of the men go up to the speaker, comforting him, leading him away. A LEADER takes the stand.
C: LEADER
D: Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
N: Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:
C: EVERYONE
D: Thank you, Thomas.
E: in unison
C: LEADER
D: I look around this room and I see a lot of courage. And it gives me strength. We give each other strength.
N: Jack looks around. Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing. Jack squirms in his seat.
C: LEADER
D: It's time for the one-on-one. Let's follow Thomas's example and open ourselves.
N: Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off. Jack stands, uncomfortable.
C: LEADER
D: Can everyone find a partner?
N: Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet.
C: JACK
D: The big moosie, his eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears. Knees together, invisible steps.
E: V.O.
N: Bob takes Jack into an embrace.
C: JACK
D: Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You know that chest expansion program you see on TV? That was his idea.
E: V.O.
C: BOB
D: ...using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
C: JACK
D: Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
E: V.O.
N: Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder and completely covering Jack's face. After a long beat of crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.
C: BOB
D: Go ahead, Cornelius. You can cry.
N: They look at each other. Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.
C: JACK
D: Then... something happened. I was lost in oblivion -- dark and silent and complete.
E: V.O.
N: Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest. Jack tightens his arms around Bob.
C: JACK
D: I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.
E: V.O.
N: Jack pulls away from Bob. On Bob's chest, there's a WET MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.
C: JACK
D: Babies don't sleep this well.

N: Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN. He begins to cry along with her. A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."
C: JACK
D: If I didn't say anything, people assumed the worst. They cried harder. I cried harder.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES CLOSED. The Leader speaks into a microphone.
C: LEADER
D: Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
C: JACK
D: I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
E: V.O.
C: LEADER
D: ...And you open the door and you step inside. We're inside our hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light. That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
N: Jack, eyes closed, is silent...
C: LEADER
D: It moves over your body, healing you. Keep this going and step forward, through the back door of the room. Where does it lead? To your cave. Step forward into your cave.
S: INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION
N: Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...
C: LEADER'S VOICE
D: That's right. You're going deeper into your cave. And you're going to find your power animal...
N: Jack comes upon a PENGUIN. The penguin looks at him, cocks his head to signal Jack forward.
C: PENGUIN
D: Slide.
N: The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people. He walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

E: V.O.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING
N: Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.
C: JACK
D: Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too. Being there, my face against his tits, ready to cry -- this was my vacation.
E: V.O.
N: MARLA SINGER enters. She has short matte black hair and big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.
C: JACK
D: And, she ruined everything.
E: V.O.
N: Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.
C: MARLA
D: This is cancer, right?
N: Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.
S: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER
N: Everyone paired-off. MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE. She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.
C: JACK
D: This ... chick ... Marla Singer ... did not have testicular cancer. She was a liar.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while a member speaks. Jack spies on her.
C: JACK
D: She had no diseases at all. I had seen her at my melanoma Monday night group ...
E: V.O.
S: INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
N: Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking. All the faces down the row are turned toward her, incredulous...
C: JACK
D: ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood parasites group Thursdays.
E: V.O.
N: Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.
C: JACK
D: -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my tuberculosis Friday night.
E: V.O.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
N: Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by. She opens her eyes, catching Jack's stare. Jack looks away.
C: JACK
D: Marla -- the big tourist. Her lie reflected my lie.
E: V.O.
N: Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder. Tears roll down her cheeks. She wipes at them.
S: EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Marla walks out, The support group's dispersing. Jack exits amongst them. He spots Marla walking away.
C: JACK
D: And suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry. So, once again, I could not sleep.
E: V.O.
N: Jack stares after Marla for a long moment. He walks away.
S: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
N: Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.
C: JACK
D: No, I just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number.
E: into phone
N: Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.
C: JACK
D: Next group, after guided meditation, after we open our chakras, when it's time to hug, I'm going to grab that little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her arms against her sides and say...
E: V.O.
S: INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

C: JACK
D: Marla, you liar, you big tourist. I need this. Get out.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.
C: JACK
D: When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake. I hadn't slept in four days...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around. People are chattering with each other.
C: JACK
D: -- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive. They never said "parasite;" they said "agent." They always talked about getting better.
E: V.O.
C: LEADER
D: Okay, everyone.
N: Everyone sits in chairs. Jack catches sight of Marla.
C: LEADER
D: To open tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words.
N: Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin stretches yellowish and tight over her bones. She wears a head bondage. She clears her throat.
C: JACK
D: Ahh, Chloe. Chloe looked the way Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everyone.
E: V.O.
C: CHLOE
D: Well, I'm still here -- but I don't know for how long. That's as much certainty as anyone can give me. but I've got some good news -- I no longer have any fear of death.
N: APPLAUSE from around the room.
C: CHLOE
D: But... I am in a pretty lonely place. No one will have sex with me. I'm so close to the end and all I want is to get laid for the last time. I have pornographic movies in my apartment, and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...
N: The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.
C: LEADER
D: Thank you, Chloe. Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
C: EVERYONE
D: Thank you, Chloe.
S: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER
C: LEADER
D: Now, you're standing at the entrance to your cave. You step inside your cave and you walk. Keep walking.
N: Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.
C: JACK
D: If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla. Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
E: V.O.
C: LEADER
D: Now, find your power animal.
S: INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

C: MARLA
D: Slide.
S: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

S: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER
N: Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.
C: LEADER
D: Pick someone special to you tonight.
N: Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him. He tries to smile. She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.
C: CHLOE
D: Hello, Mr. Tayler.
C: JACK
D: I never gave my real name at support groups.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: Hi, Chloe.
C: CHLOE
D: We've never actually talked.
N: Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation. Jack, in a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:
C: JACK
D: You look good. You ... look ... like a pirate.
N: Chloe laughs, a little too much. Jack squeezes out a laugh. Then he sees Marla, off by herself. Someone heads for her.
C: JACK
D: Excuse me, I have to...
N: Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla. Chloe watches him go. STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her. He whispers into her ear.
C: JACK
D: We need to talk.
C: MARLA
D: Sure.
C: JACK
D: I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
C: MARLA
D: What?
C: JACK
D: Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
C: LEADER
D: Tell the other person how you feel.
C: JACK
D: You're a tourist. I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
C: MARLA
D: And I saw you practicing this...
C: JACK
D: Practicing what?
C: MARLA
D: Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped... ? "... Mr. Taylor."
E: reads his nametag
C: JACK
D: I'll expose you.
C: MARLA
D: Go ahead. I'll expose you.
C: LEADER
D: Share yourself completely.
N: Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying. Jack pulls her head back up. She deadpans at him.
C: JACK
D: Why are you doing this?
C: MARLA
D: It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
C: JACK
D: These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year.
C: MARLA
D: A year? How'd you manage that?
C: JACK
D: Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
C: LEADER
D: Let yourself cry.
C: MARLA
D: Why do you do it?
C: JACK
D: I... I don't know. I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
C: MARLA
D: -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
C: JACK
D: Yeah.
N: Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.
C: LEADER
D: Quietly, now. Share with each other.
N: Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.
C: JACK
D: It becomes an addiction.
E: warning
C: MARLA
D: Really?
N: Jack sighs, then pulls back.
C: JACK
D: Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
C: MARLA
D: Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
C: JACK
D: Please. Can't we do something... ?
N: Marla starts out of the room. Jack follows her.
C: LEADER
D: Now, the closing prayer.
S: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.
C: JACK
D: We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
C: MARLA
D: You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
C: JACK
D: I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
C: MARLA
D: Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls.
C: JACK
D: You're kidding.
C: MARLA
D: I don't know -- am I?
N: Jack follow Marla into...
S: INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS
N: Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER. She takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.
C: MARLA
D: I'll take the parasites.
C: JACK
D: You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites --
C: MARLA
D: I want brain parasites.
C: JACK
D: Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
C: MARLA
D: I want that.
C: JACK
D: You can't have the whole brain!
C: MARLA
D: So far, you have four and I only have two!
C: JACK
D: Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three.
N: Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...
S: EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack follows, bewildered.
C: JACK
D: You... left half your clothes.
N: HONK! Jack starts. Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down. Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS BLARING. Jack dashes, following...
S: INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter. An old CLERK sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.
C: JACK
D: You're selling those?
N: Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot. He winces in pain.
C: MARLA
D: Yes, I'm selling some chothes.
E: for the Clerk to hear
N: The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.
C: MARLA
D: So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
C: JACK
D: The girl had done her homework.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: I want ascending bowel cancer.
N: The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.
C: MARLA
D: That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
C: JACK
D: We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
C: MARLA
D: Deal.
N: They shake. Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.
C: MARLA
D: Looks like this is goodbye.
C: JACK
D: Let's not make a big thing out of it.
N: She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.
C: MARLA
D: How's this for not making a big thing?
N: Jack watches her go. A moment, then he follows after...
S: EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...
C: JACK
D: Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
C: MARLA
D: Should we?
C: JACK
D: In case we want to switch nights.
C: MARLA
D: I suppose.
N: Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the back, hands it to her. She takes the pen, grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm. She walks into the street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING. She turns, holds up the card.
C: MARLA
D: It doesn't have your name. Who are you? Cornelius? Mr. Taylor? Dr. Zaius? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
N: Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud. Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving. A BUS moves into view, obscuring her.
C: JACK
D: This is how I met Marla Singer.

It's tuned to the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a large BANQUET ROOM. Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.
S: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT
N: Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN. They chat. Jack turns to look at his food, takes a bite. He turns back and it's... --a BALD MAN next to him, talking. Jack takes another bite, turns back and it's... --a BUSINESSMAN next to him. Jack takes another bite, turns back, and it's... --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.
C: JACK
D: The people I meet on each flight -- they're single-serving friends. Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING
N: Jack's eyes snap open.
C: JACK
D: You wake up at Logan.
E: V.O.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.
C: JACK
D: On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
E: V.O.
N: Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a WRECKED AUTOMOBILE. Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.
C: JACK
D: I'm a recall coordinator. My job is to apply the formula. It's a story problem.
E: V.O.
N: TECHNICIAN #1 Here's where the infant went through the windshield. Three points.
C: JACK
D: A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour. The rear differential locks up.
E: V.O.
N: TECHNICIAN #2 The teenager's braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good "anti-smoking" ad.
C: JACK
D: The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now: do we initiate a recall?
E: V.O.
N: TECHNICIAN #1 The father must've been huge. See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with his polyester shirt? Very "modern art."
C: JACK
D: Take the number of vehicles in the field, , and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, , then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, . A times B times C equals X...
E: V.O. A B C
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY
N: Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.
C: JACK
D: If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
C: BUSISNESS WOMAN
D: Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
C: JACK
D: Oh, you wouldn't believe.
C: BUSINESS WOMAN
D: ... Which... car company do you work for?
C: JACK
D: A major one.
N: Turgid silence. Jack turns to the window. He sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.
C: JACK
D: Every time the plane banked too sharply on take-off or landing, I prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision -- anything.
E: V.O.
N: Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles. People panic. Masks drop.
C: JACK
D: No more haircuts. Nothing matters, not even bad breath.
E: V.O.
N: The side of the plane SHEARS OFF! Screaming PASSENGERS are sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering wind. Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.
C: JACK
D: Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
E: V.O.
N: Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression. DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT. Jack SNAPS AWAKE. EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. Some passengers get out of their seats. From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...
C: VOICE
D: There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice...
N: Jack turns to see TYLER. Without turned to Jack, Tyler continues:
C: TYLER
D: Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
C: JACK
D: Pardon me?
N: Tyler turns to Jack.
C: JACK
D: This is how I met --
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Tyler Durden.
N: Tyler offers his hand. Jack takes it.
C: TYLER
D: You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
C: JACK
D: No, supply oxygen?
C: TYLER
D: Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
N: Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback, hands it to Jack.
C: TYLER
D: Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile. We accept our fate.
N: Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.
C: TYLER
D: Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour. Blank faces -- calm as Hindu cows.
N: Jack laughs.
C: JACK
D: What do you do, Tyler?
C: TYLER
D: What do you want me to do?
C: JACK
D: I mean -- for a living.
C: TYLER
D: Why? So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
N: Jack laughs. Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a BRIEFCASE.
C: TYLER
D: You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
N: Jack points to his own briefcase.
C: JACK
D: We have the same briefcase.
N: Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.
C: TYLER
D: Open it.
N: Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.
C: TYLER
D: Soap -- the yardstick of civilization. I make and sell soap...
E: reaches in his pocket
N: Tyler hands Jack his card. "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."
C: TYLER
D: If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin. With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined.
N: Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut. Jack stares.
C: JACK
D: Tyler, you are by far the most interesting "single-serving" friend I've ever met.
N: Tyler stares back. Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans closer to Tyler.
C: JACK
D: You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
C: TYLER
D: The spork. I get it. You're very clever.
C: JACK
D: Thank you.
C: TYLER
D: How's that working out for you?
C: JACK
D: What?
C: TYLER
D: Being clever.
C: JACK
D: Well, uh... great.
E: thrown
C: TYLER
D: Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
N: Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.
C: TYLER
D: ... As I squeeze past, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
N: Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...
C: TYLER
D: We are defined by the choices we make.
N: Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the curtain aside and sits in an empty seat. Jack watches.
C: JACK
D: How I came to live with Tyler is: airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
N: Utterly empty of baggage. No people except for Jack and a SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN. The Security TFM, smirking, holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.
C: SECURITY TFM
D: Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
E: to Jack
C: JACK
D: Excuse me? "Throwers?"
C: SECURITY TFM
D: Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
C: JACK
D: My suitcase was vibrating?
C: SECURITY TFM
D: Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor. But, every once in a while ... ...it's a dildo. It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo." Never "Your dildo."
E: whispers
N: Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE. Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS OUT. jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM. In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the convertible, SCREAMING.
C: JACK
D: I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
E: to Security TFM
C: SECURITY TFM
D: Yeah, uh huh... yeah? Oh...
E: into phone pause, still on phone
S: EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY
N: A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete. SECURITY PERSONNEL keep their distance. KABOOM! The suitcase explodes.
S: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING
N: The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.
C: SECURITY TFM
D: I'm terribly sorry.
N: The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form. Jack snatches it, disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.
C: SECURITY TFM
D: You know the industry slang for "Flight Attendant?" "Air Mattress."
S: INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Along a residential street. Jack looks ahead, sees a tall, grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.
C: JACK
D: Home was a condo on the fifteenth floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals. The walls were solid concrete. A foot of concrete is important when your next- door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume...
E: V.O.
N: The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the building. A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN- OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor. FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.
C: JACK
D: -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out your floor- to-ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING
N: Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the Cabbie money. The taxi pulls away. Jack starts toward the building. He pushes through the fray of people, into the...
S: INT. LOBBY
N: The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his head. Jack starts for the elevator.
C: DOORMAN
D: There's nothing up there.
N: Jack presses the button. The Doorman moves next to him.
C: DOORMAN
D: You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
N: The elevator doors open. Jack hesitates. The doors close. Jack heads out the lobby doors. The Doorman follows...
S: EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR. His feet CRUNCH glass.
C: JACK
D: How embarrassing.
E: V.O.
C: DOORMAN
D: Do you have somebody you can call?
N: Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side. He reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone number, from under a BANANA MAGNET. CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE Hissing.
C: JACK
D: The police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out... letting out just a little bit of gas.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
N: Jack gets to a PAYPHONE. The Doorman follows, watching him.
C: DOORMAN
D: Lots of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things.
N: Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter. He looks at Marla's number a long moment. CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM The SOUND of the HISS...
C: JACK
D: The gas could have slowly filled the condo. Seventeen-hundred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
N: Jack replaces the receiver. He pockets Marla's number, digs out a small FILOFAX. He flips through the pages for phone numbers and addresses. Most of the pages are blank.
C: DOORMAN
D: Many young people feel trapped and desperate.
N: INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR
C: JACK
D: Then, the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on...
E: V.O.
N: Click. KABOOM! SCREEN GOES WHITE.
S: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
N: Jack looks at the Doorman. Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from the Filofax. Jack catches it.
C: DOORMAN
D: If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.
N: The Doorman walks away. Jack stares at Tyler's card.
C: JACK
D: If you asked me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.
E: V.O.
N: Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number. It RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS. Jack sighs and hangs up the phone. A moment, then the phone RINGS.
C: JACK
D: Hello?
C: TYLER'S VOICE
D: Who's this?
C: JACK
D: Tyler?
C: TYLER'S VOICE
D: Who's this?
C: JACK
D: Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
C: TYLER'S VOICE
D: Oh, yeah.
C: JACK
D: I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
C: TYLER'S VOICE
D: I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
C: JACK
D: Well... let me see... here's the thing...
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT
N: A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.
S: INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME
N: Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.
C: JACK
D: You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette.
C: TYLER
D: This is how we fill up our lives.
N: Tyler lights a cigarette.
C: JACK
D: I guess so.
C: TYLER
D: And, now it's gone.
C: JACK
D: All gone.
N: Tyler offers cigarettes. Jack declines.
C: TYLER
D: Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
C: JACK
D: There's always that.
C: TYLER
D: I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
C: JACK
D: ...no ...no ...
C: TYLER
D: I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
N: Jack laughs, nods. He shakes his head, drinks.
C: TYLER
D: But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
C: JACK
D: Delivered from Swedish furniture.
E: toasts
C: TYLER
D: Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
C: JACK
D: Delivered from Martha Stewart.
C: TYLER
D: Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
N: They laugh together. Then, silence. They drink.
C: JACK
D: Insurance'll cover it.
C: TYLER
D: Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
C: JACK
D: What list?
C: TYLER
D: The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list.
C: JACK
D: I don't... think so.
C: TYLER
D: This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
C: JACK
D: Well, I have to file a claim...
C: TYLER
D: The things you own, they end up owning you.
C: JACK
D: Don't I?
C: TYLER
D: Do what you like.
C: JACK
D: God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
E: looks at watch
C: TYLER
D: A hotel?
C: JACK
D: Yeah.
C: TYLER
D: So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
C: JACK
D: I don't follow...
C: TYLER
D: We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
C: JACK
D: Huh?
C: TYLER
D: You called me so you could have a place to stay.
C: JACK
D: No, I...
C: TYLER
D: Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
C: JACK
D: Would that be a problem?
C: TYLER
D: Is it a problem for you to ask?
C: JACK
D: Can I stay at your place?
C: TYLER
D: Yes, you can.
C: JACK
D: Thank you.
C: TYLER
D: You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
C: JACK
D: What's that?
C: TYLER
D: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
C: JACK
D: What?
C: TYLER
D: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
N: Freeze picture.
C: JACK
D: Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
E: V.O.
N: EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.
S: INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT
N: Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA. In the BACKGROUND, Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from movies. Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.
C: JACK
D: Tyler was a night person. He sometimes worked as a projectionist. A movie doesn't come in one big reel, it's on a few. In old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins. Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner...
N: Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.
C: TYLER
D: They're called "cigarette burns."
C: JACK
D: It's called a "changeover." The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
C: TYLER
D: Why would anyone want this shitty job?
C: JACK
D: It affords him other interesting opportunities.
C: TYLER
D: -- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
C: JACK
D: In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
N: In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming, confused, looking at each other. A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling vaguely terrible. Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans back in his seat. Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.
C: TYLER
D: One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there.
C: JACK
D: No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
C: TYLER
D: A nice, big cock.
C: JACK
D: Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
S: INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
N: Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP BOWLS. Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.
C: JACK
D: Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
N: The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.
S: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a giant SOUP TUREEN. His hands are at his open fly and he's in position to piss into the soup.
C: JACK
D: He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
C: TYLER
D: Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
N: Jack waits. The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.
C: TYLER
D: ... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
C: JACK
D: He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
C: TYLER
D: Go ahead. Say it.
E: O.S.
C: JACK
D: You get the idea.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING
N: Tyler and Jack come out the back door.
C: JACK
D: I don't know about this.
C: TYLER
D: I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you?
C: JACK
D: No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
C: TYLER
D: I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
C: JACK
D: Me?
N: Jack stares at him.
C: TYLER
D: Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
C: JACK
D: This is crazy.
C: TYLER
D: Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
C: JACK
D: Where do you want it? In the face?
C: TYLER
D: Surprise me.
N: Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.
C: JACK
D: Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
C: TYLER
D: Like hell. That counted.
N: Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest. Jack falls back against a car. His eyes tear up.
C: TYLER
D: How do you feel?
C: JACK
D: Strange.
C: TYLER
D: But a good strange.
C: JACK
D: Is it?
C: TYLER
D: We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
C: JACK
D: Call what off?
C: TYLER
D: The fight.
C: JACK
D: What fight?
C: TYLER
D: This fight, pussy.
N: Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's ear. Tyler punches Jack in the stomach. Tyler and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches. They breathe heavier, drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.
S: EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER
N: Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights on the nearby freeway. Their eyes are glazed with endorphin- induced serenity. They look at each other, laugh. Look away.
C: TYLER
D: If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
C: JACK
D: Anyone?
C: TYLER
D: Anyone.
N: Jack thinks.
C: JACK
D: My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
E: pause
C: TYLER
D: My dad. No question.
N: A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.
C: JACK
D: Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
E: nodding
C: TYLER
D: He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
C: JACK
D: I know that.
C: TYLER
D: After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?" He said, "Get a job." When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?" He said, "I don't know. Get married."
C: JACK
D: Same here.
C: TYLER
D: A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
N: Another pause. Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.
C: JACK
D: We should do this again sometime.
N: Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.
S: EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT
N: A street sign: "PAPER STREET." A PAPER MILL stis on one side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other. The rest of the land is grass and weeds. It's a grand, old three-story, long abandoned. Tyler leads Jack toward it.
C: JACK
D: Where's your car?
C: TYLER
D: What car?
C: JACK
D: I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
N: Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...
C: JACK
D: It looked like it was waiting to be torn down. Most of the windows were boarded up.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER
N: Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.
C: JACK
D: None of the doors locked. The stairs were ready to collapse. I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...
S: INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED. Dust drifts upwards.
C: JACK
D: Neither would have surprised me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SHOWER - MORNING
N: Jack turns on the water. LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls. Water spits in starts.
C: JACK
D: Nothing worked. The rusty plumbing leaked. Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: All the tavern's lights are off. Tyler and Jack FIGHT. FIVE GUYS stand around watching.
S: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee with a wire-mesh strainer. Tyler shuffles in, wearing a flannel bathrobe. He spears pieces of bread on a fork, starts roasting them over a burner.
C: JACK
D: There were no neighbors. Just warehouses and the paper mill. The fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB -- THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.
C: JACK
D: At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: All the lights are off. TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack and Tyler, who FIGHT. THREE CARS are parked in the lot.
S: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
N: Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a certain order, showing Jack how it's done.
C: JACK
D: When it rained, we had to kill the power. By the end of the first month, I didn't care about TV. I didn't mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
E: V.O.
S: INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT
N: CANDLES BURN. Tyler and Jack are seated across from each other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES. Rain DRIPS from the ceiling. No furniture. THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.
C: JACK
D: The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Hum.
E: of magazine
C: JACK
D: What?
C: TYLER
D: Oh, a new riot control grenade... "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
E: reading
N: Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.
C: JACK
D: "I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells." There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
E: "Reader's Digest"
C: TYLER
D: "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
N: Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles, chooses another magazine.
C: JACK
D: What are you reading?
C: TYLER
D: Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
C: JACK
D: Show-off.
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: All the lights are off. Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING. The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY than before. In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.
C: JACK
D: I should have been haggling with my insurance company. I should have been looking for a new condo...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Jack walks along. He stops, looking at a CHURCH with SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking coffee and sodas. Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.
C: JACK
D: .... I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit.
E: V.O.
N: Jack's face shows no reaction. He continues to walk.
C: JACK
D: But I wasn't.
E: V.O.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips. Tyler, in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.
C: JACK
D: Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
E: V.O.
N: Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.
C: JACK
D: But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday night...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: All the lights are off. No one around, but there are at least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.
C: JACK
D: ... we were finding something out: we were finding out, more and more, that we were not alone.

S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER. Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.
C: JACK
D: Thursday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.
E: V.O.
N: Boss gives Jack a dubious look. Walter's next SLIDE: a COMPUTER SCREEN.
C: WALTER
D: The basic premise of cyber-netting your office is -- make things more efficient.
C: BOSS
D: Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
C: WALTER
D: Absolutely.
N: Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:
C: JACK
D: Walter, the Microsoft account exec. Walter, with his smooth, soft hands. Maybe he was thinking about the free- range potluck he'd been to last weekend, or his church-group car-wash fund-raiser. Or, probably not.
E: V.O.
N: Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.
C: WALTER
D: I showed this already to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?
N: Jack smiles. His teeth are RED with BLOOD. They GLOW eerily in the dim light.
C: JACK
D: You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
E: V.O.
C: WALTER
D: Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened to the other guy.
N: Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.
C: JACK
D: Screw Walter. His candy-ass wouldn't last a second Wednesday night.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT
N: Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all directions. CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed lot. YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...
S: INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME
N: The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against the back wall, waiting. The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:
C: IRVINE
D: Drink up people. We're closing.
N: Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS. Drunken customers squint and get the message. They plop down money, leaving.
C: JACK
D: It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible.
E: V.O.
N: Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power. Members of the waiting army begins to share secret looks. Finally, one buy locks the door. Two other guys close the blinds.
C: JACK
D: It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a name.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME
N: A BOMB-SHELTER. Concrete walls. One BARE BULB above, Tyler standing directly beneath it.
C: TYLER
D: Welcome to fight club.
N: The guys mill around, finding partners. Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool. CHATTER gets LOUDER. Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.
C: JACK
D: Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
E: V.O.
N: PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER DIES. A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.
C: TYLER
D: The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says "stop" or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule -- one fight at a time. Sixth rule -- no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.
N: Tyler steps back. A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.
C: JACK
D: This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ...
E: V.O.
N: The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...
C: JACK
D: But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size.
E: V.O.
N: Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two. SWEAT flies. SHOUTS become DEAFENING. Ricky's getting the best of Goateed Man, POUNDING him...
C: JACK
D: Sometimes all you could hear were flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling, or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
E: V.O.
C: GOATEED MAN
D: Ssssstop... !
E: spittle-lipped
S: INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.
C: JACK
D: Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
E: V.O.
N: The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda down on the table. The two of them briefly make eye contact.
C: JACK
D: Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY
N: Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light. He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an apron, push a supply cart. Ricks nods at Jack.
C: JACK
D: You weren't alive anywhere like you were there. But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief. Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.
C: BOSS
D: What are you getting yourself into every week?
N: Jack keeps playing Solitaire. Boss enters, folds his arms.
C: JACK
D: After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything.
E: V.O.
C: BOSS
D: Have you finished those reports?
C: JACK
D: Yes.
E: handing him reports
C: JACK
D: The people who had power over you have less and less.
E: V.O.
N: Jack looks at Boss. Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth.
C: JACK
D: By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STREET - DUSK
N: Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.
C: JACK
D: A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: If you could fight any celebrity?
C: TYLER
D: Alive or dead?
C: JACK
D: Doesn't matter.
C: TYLER
D: Hemingway. You?
C: JACK
D: Shatner. William Shatner.
N: They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their cigarettes, getting on board...
S: INT. BUS - DUSK
N: The bus is crowded. As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back, Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...
C: JACK
D: We all started seeing things differently. Wherever we went.
E: V.O.
N: They hold hand grips. Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.
C: JACK
D: I felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.
C: TYLER
D: Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction is the answer.
N: A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes. The Man takes a handle, close by. Jack's pissed, staring at the man, who stares back.
C: JACK
D: You could take him.
E: to Tyler, so the Man can hear
N: Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man. Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.
C: TYLER
D: The trick is not to care.
N: Tyler stares forward.
S: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first. HIS OPPONENT lands on top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD. The surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them... Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him. Tyler turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...
T: CUT TO:
N: Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach -- brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw. Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat. Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.
C: JACK
D: Fight club wasn't about winning or losing. It wasn't about words.
E: V.O.
N: The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack. Jack snakes his arm into a counter headlock. They wrestle like wild animals. The crowd CHEERS maniacally.
C: JACK
D: They hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.
E: V.O.
N: Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER. The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.
C: JACK
D: ... stop...
C: JACK
D: When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered.
E: V.O.
N: Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away. Tyler pushes through the crowd. Others lift Jack up. They turn their attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face -- similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.
C: TYLER
D: Cool.
N: Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.
C: OPPONENT
D: How about next week?
C: JACK
D: Look at me. How about next month?
N: Everyone helps Jack walk. He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.
C: JACK
D: Afterwards, we all felt saved.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
N: A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.
C: TYLER
D: He fell down some stairs.
N: The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.
C: JACK
D: I fell down some stairs.
C: JACK
D: Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR. Tyler's clipping at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS. Jack's brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.
C: JACK
D: Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Any historical figure.
C: JACK
D: Okay... Ghandi.
C: TYLER
D: Good answer.
C: JACK
D: You?
C: TYLER
D: Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
N: Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a TOOTH. Jack looks at it. Tyler puts scissors down, done.
C: TYLER
D: Remember, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
N: Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.
S: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Jack enters, buttoning his shirt. The PHONE RINGS.
C: JACK
D: Hello?
T: INTERCUT WITH...
S: INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME
N: Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone cord around her neck.
C: MARLA
D: Where have you been the last few weeks?
C: JACK
D: Marla?
N: Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups. Jack leans, cups the phone.
C: JACK
D: How did you find me?
E: quietly
C: MARLA
D: The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
C: JACK
D: That's the idea -- we split them.
C: MARLA
D: You haven't been going to yours.
C: JACK
D: I found a new one.
C: MARLA
D: Really?
C: JACK
D: It's for men.
C: MARLA
D: Like testicular cancer?
C: JACK
D: Look, this is a bad time...
C: MARLA
D: I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
C: JACK
D: I'm just on my way out...
C: MARLA
D: Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much.
N: Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.
C: JACK
D: Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
E: V.O.
C: MARLA
D: This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
C: JACK
D: This could go on for hours.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: So you're staying in tonight?
C: MARLA
D: Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
N: Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door.
C: MARLA'S VOICE
D: Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone?
N: Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.
S: INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
N: GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION. Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT. Sheets RIP. Bodies hit the FLOOR. Insane GRUNTING and LAUGHING. A flash of MARLA'S FACE.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE
N: Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.
S: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING
N: Jack steps out of his room. The neighboring door is closed.

E: V.O.
S: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
N: Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.
C: JACK
D: You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night.
N: Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane. Jack's jaw drops.
C: MARLA
D: I can hardly believe anything about last night.
N: Marla goes to pour coffee. She takes a swig, GARGLES and SPITS it in the sink. She gives Jack a lascivious smile.
C: JACK
D: What are you doing here?
C: MARLA
D: What... ?
C: JACK
D: What the hell are you doing here?
N: Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.
C: MARLA
D: Fuck you.
N: Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack gets up, watches her stomp away. Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla. He's in his usual sweatpants. He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee. Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest. Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.
C: TYLER
D: She's a piece of work. Get this -- I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook...
N: Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler. TYLER'S
T: VOICE FADES...
C: JACK
D: I already knew the story before he told it to me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
N: Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.
C: MARLA'S VOICE
D: I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body.
E: from handset
N: Tyler smiles.
C: JACK
D: How could Tyler, off all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?
E: V.O.
S: INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
N: Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars, looking at the rotting walls. He reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's room. Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...
S: INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
N: Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door. Her drugged eyes look him over.
C: MARLA
D: You got here fast.
N: She staggers and sits on the bed. She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.
C: MARLA
D: The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic.
N: She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.
C: MARLA
D: Did I call you?
N: Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO lying atop a dresser. Marla follows his gaze.
C: MARLA
D: Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
N: SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.
C: MARLA
D: Oh, no! Somebody called the cops...
N: She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.
S: INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)
N: Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE. COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits. Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.
C: COP
D: 8-G! Where's 8-G?
C: MARLA
D: End of the hall.
E: pointing
N: The rescuers keep running.
C: MARLA
D: The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself...
E: calling after
C: COP
D: Miss Singer, let us help you! You have every reason to live!
N: Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.
C: MARLA
D: She's a monster! Infectious human waste! Good luck trying to save her!
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Tyler makes coffee. Marla slouches against the refrigerator.
C: MARLA
D: If I fall asleep, I'm done for. You're gonna have to keep me up all night.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)
N: Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.
C: TYLER
D: Unbelievable, huh?
C: JACK
D: He was obviously able to handle it.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.
C: TYLER
D: I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
C: JACK
D: No. Not at all.
C: JACK
D: I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler lights his cigarette.
C: TYLER
D: You're sure?
C: JACK
D: Yeah, I'm sure.
C: TYLER
D: Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
S: INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Tyler smokes, post-coital. Marla puts her lips to his ear.
C: MARLA
D: I want to have your abortion.
E: whispering
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)
N: Tyler laughs, shakes his head. Jack's gripping his Reader's Digest just a little too tight.
C: JACK
D: How could Tyler not go for that? Night before last, he was splicing sex organs into "Little Mermaid."
E: V.O.
N: Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.
C: TYLER
D: You're okay with this?
C: JACK
D: I'm fine.
C: JACK
D: Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains.
E: V.O.
N: Tyler smokes.
C: TYLER
D: She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
C: JACK
D: Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
C: TYLER
D: Hey... don't knock librarians.
C: JACK
D: Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
C: TYLER
D: She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
C: JACK
D: She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
N: Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it. Jack puts down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.
C: JACK
D: What?
C: TYLER
D: You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit.
N: Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.
C: TYLER
D: If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me.
C: JACK
D: Okay.
C: TYLER
D: Promise you won't.
C: JACK
D: Yes, I promise.
C: TYLER
D: Promise?
C: JACK
D: I said I promise!
C: TYLER
D: That was three times you promised.
N: Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves. Jack sits smoldering.
C: JACK
D: If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla die, none of this would have happened.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME. SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.
S: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling. Sounds of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.
C: MARLA'S VOICE
D: Miserable fucking discharge!
E: muffled through wall
C: JACK
D: I could've moved to another room, one on the third floor -- so I wouldn't have heard them. But I didn't.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: SOUNDS of RAIN. Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.
S: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME
N: Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm. He reaches the landing. Tyler's door is ajar. Jack peeks in... Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed. The door PUSHES OPEN WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.
C: TYLER
D: What are you doing?
N: Jack steps back.
C: JACK
D: I... uh... just going to bed.
N: Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.
C: TYLER
D: You want to finish her off?
C: JACK
D: Uh... nah...
N: Jack continues toward his room.
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack brushes his teeth.
C: JACK
D: I became the calm, little center of the world. I was the Zen master.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font. "Worker bees can leave Even drones can fly away The queen is their slave"
C: JACK
D: I wrote little haiku poems.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD. He sits in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.
C: JACK
D: I faxed them around to everyone.
E: V.O.
N: He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND. He presses this key over and over. Boss enters.
C: BOSS
D: Is that your blood?
C: JACK
D: Some of it, yes.
N: Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.
C: BOSS
D: Take the rest of the day off. Come back tomorrow with clean clothes. Get yourself together.
S: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
N: Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS who coldly stare at him. His face is totally passive.
C: JACK
D: I got right in everyone's hostile little face. Yes, these are bruises from fighting. I'm comfortable with them. I am enlightened.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET
N: Jack walks toward the HOUSE.
C: JACK
D: You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions, go live in a dilapidated house in the toxic waste part of town...
E: V.O.
S: INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET
N: Jack walks in. SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA from upstairs. Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.
C: JACK
D: ... and you come home to this.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER'S VOICE
D: You fucking slut!!
E: laughing
C: MARLA'S VOICE
D: Thank you, sir, may I have another! Thank you sir, may I have another... !
N: Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants. He runs water in the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood stains. The PHONE RINGS. He answers it.
C: JACK
D: Yeah. Speaking.
T: INTERCUT WITH...
S: INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE
N: A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: This is Detective Stern with the arson unit. We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
C: JACK
D: Yes?
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
C: JACK
D: No, I wasn't aware...
C: JACK
D: I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
E: V.O.
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: Does this sound strange to you?
C: JACK
D: Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.
N: Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: The dynamite...
C: JACK
D: Dynamite?
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: Yes. It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
C: JACK
D: What does that mean?
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: It means it was homemade.
C: JACK
D: This is... really a shock...
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
C: JACK
D: Who do you think could've done this?
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: I'll ask the questions, son.
C: TYLER
D: Tell him...
E: whispering in Jack's ear
N: Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler standing right next to him.
C: JACK
D: Huh?
C: TYLER
D: "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
E: overlap w/below
C: JACK
D: Shhhhhh! I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
E: into phone, overlap w/above
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: Do you know anyone who'd have the expertise or motive to do something like this?
C: TYLER
D: "I reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material possession."
N: Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.
C: JACK
D: No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants were...
E: into phone
C: JACK
D: I'd like to thank the academy...
E: V.O.
C: DETECTIVE STERN
D: Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call. In the meantime, don't leave town. I may need to bring you in for questioning.
T: END INTERCUT
N: Jack hangs up. Tyler shrugs.
C: TYLER
D: Could be worse. You could be cursed with the three terrible Karmas. You could be beautiful, rich and famous.
N: Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants. Marla's FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs... Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing water. He turns, sees Marla enter. Tyler is GONE. Marla lights a cigarette.
C: JACK
D: Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
E: V.O.
C: MARLA
D: I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
C: JACK
D: Worth every penny.
E: keeps scrubbing
C: JACK
D: My parents pulled this exact act for years -- one came in, the other disappeared.
E: V.O.
N: Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to Jack. She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close to Jack's body, almost touhcing.
C: MARLA
D: It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree -- so special, then, bam -- it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it...
E: seductive
N: Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses against the counter. Marla pulls her hemline further up.
C: MARLA
D: Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
C: JACK
D: It suits you.
E: coldly
N: She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:
C: MARLA
D: You can borrow it sometime.
N: Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing. Marla blows smoke in his face. Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink. Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.
C: TYLER
D: Get rid of her.
E: O.S.
N: Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.
C: JACK
D: You get rid of her.
C: TYLER
D: Don't mention me.
E: pointing at Jack
N: Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS. Jack looks to the archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE. Marla enters, shoes and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something on the junk strewn table.
C: JACK
D: I'm six years old again, passing messages between my parents.
E: V.O.
C: JACK
D: I, uh... think you should go now.
N: Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things, pushing other things off to the floor.
C: JACK
D: It's time for you to leave.
C: MARLA
D: Don't worry, I'm leaving.
N: Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes. She moves up into Jack's face.
C: MARLA
D: You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
C: JACK
D: Goodbye.
N: She laughs, spins on her heels. As she exits the back door, she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls." Jack watches her through the kitchen window.
C: TYLER
D: Nice work.
E: O.S.
N: Jack turns. Tyler's right behind him. Through the window, Marla can be seen walking away. Tyler picks up the remnant of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.
C: TYLER
D: To make soap, first we have to render fat.
N: Jack looks at Tyler. CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."
S: EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT
N: Tyler stands inside the fence. Jack's atop the fence, struggling to cross BARBED WIRE. He wobbles, gets over, snags his shirt. Jack falls, RIPPPPP. Tyler helps. FOOTSTEPS. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM. Tyler pulls Jack behind a DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS. A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD moves along the perimeter, flashlight first. He walks away. MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding. Tyler eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.
C: TYLER
D: The best fat for making soap -- because the salt balance is just right -- comes form human bodies...
N: Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.
C: JACK
D: What is this place?
C: TYLER
D: A liposuction clinic.
N: From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized, thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.
C: TYLER
D: Paydirt. From society's richest asses and thighs.
N: TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying BAGS of fat. One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down the chain-link fench. Jack slips and slides. Tyler laughs. Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.
C: TYLER
D: As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
C: JACK
D: Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
C: TYLER
D: This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
N: Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer. Then, he crabs a can, opens it.
C: TYLER
D: Lye -- the crucial ingredient. Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. Why? Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Year after year, bodies burnt. Rain feel. Water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river.
E: adding lye to mix
N: Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet. He takes Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.
C: TYLER
D: The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes. Like the first monkeys shot into space.
N: The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss. Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.
C: TYLER
D: Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing.
N: Jack's whole body JERKS. Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand and arm. Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.
C: TYLER
D: This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar.
N: Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of Tyler's kiss. Jack's face spasms.
C: JACK
D: Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: Look at your hand.
C: JACK
D: Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
E: V.O.
N: SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW. RESUME: Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.
C: TYLER
D: Come back to the pain. Don't shut this out.
N: Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away. Tyler keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.
C: JACK
D: I tried not to think of the words "searing" or "flesh." I imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light.
E: V.O.
N: SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL. RESUME: Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...
C: TYLER
D: Stop it. This is your pain -- your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.
C: JACK
D: I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
E: V.O.
N: SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE. RESUME: Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again. Jack re-focuses on Tyler...
C: TYLER
D: Don't deal with this the way those dead people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.
N: SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US. RESUME: Jack tries to pull his hand free. Tyler won't let go. Jack's eyes glaze over again. Jack speaks, whiny from pain:
C: JACK
D: I... I think I understand. I think I get it...
C: TYLER
D: No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
N: SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN. RESUME: Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...
C: TYLER
D: This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
C: JACK
D: No, I'm not...
N: SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE. RESUME:
C: TYLER
D: Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
C: JACK
D: I don't know...
N: SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE. RESUME: Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...
C: TYLER
D: Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen...
C: JACK
D: It isn't... ?
C: TYLER
D: We don't need him...
C: JACK
D: We don't... ?
N: SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER MOUTH - JACK COUGHS. RESUME: Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...
C: JACK
D: ... Marla ... ?
C: TYLER
D: Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
N: Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes. Jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled knot. He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.
C: TYLER
D: You can go to the sink and run water over your hand. Look at me. Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die. Until you know that, you will be useless.
N: Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...
C: JACK
D: You ... you don't know what this feels like, Tyler.
N: Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand. Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes. Tyler grabs a bottle of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound. Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.
C: TYLER
D: Congratulations. You're a step closer to hitting bottom.
S: INT. BARNEY'S - DAY
N: Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed- over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms. There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on the counter. Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get arrested. His hand is BANDAGED.
C: JACK
D: Tyler sold the soap to department stores at twenty bucks a Ear. God knows what they charged. How ironic. We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer, smoking a cigarette. Boss enters.
C: JACK
D: He was wearing a yellow tie. It must be Thursday. I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.
E: V.O.
N: Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.
C: BOSS
D: "The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."
N: Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.
C: JACK
D: I must've left the original in the copy machine.
E: V.O.
C: BOSS
D: "The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
C: JACK
D: Hmm?
C: BOSS
D: You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
C: JACK
D: "Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image.
C: BOSS
D: Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
N: Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.
C: JACK
D: Me? I'd be very careful who I talked to about this. It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co- workers.
N: Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts tearing it into pieces.
C: JACK
D: Might be someone you've known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.
N: Jack puts the PAPER in his trash. Bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear. PHONE RINGS. Jack answers it.
C: JACK
D: Compliance and Liability.
C: MARLA'S VOICE
D: My tit's going to rot off.
C: JACK
D: Just a second. Could you excuse me? I need to take this call.
E: to Boss; smiles
N: Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.
C: JACK
D: What are you talking about?
E: into phone
N: INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...
C: MARLA
D: Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
C: JACK
D: I don't know ...
C: MARLA
D: Please.
C: JACK
D: She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET
N: Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."
S: INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Marla leads Jack inside.
C: JACK
D: This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up for ... "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
E: reads the boxes:
C: MARLA
D: Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
C: JACK
D: No, thanks.
C: MARLA
D: Good.
N: He stares at her while she eats.
C: MARLA
D: What happened to your hand?
N: Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.
C: JACK
D: Nothing.
S: INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open. Jack stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her breast. Marla's hand guides his.
C: JACK
D: Where? Here?
C: MARLA
D: Here.
C: JACK
D: There?
C: MARLA
D: Here.
C: JACK
D: Here.
C: MARLA
D: Feel anything?
C: JACK
D: No.
N: Jack's head is behind Marla's. They speak softer, slower.
C: MARLA
D: Make sure.
C: JACK
D: Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
C: MARLA
D: You feel nothing?
C: JACK
D: Nothing.
N: Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.
C: MARLA
D: Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
C: JACK
D: No... no problem.
C: MARLA
D: I wish I could return the favor.
N: Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.
C: JACK
D: I think everything's okay here.
C: MARLA
D: I could check your prostate.
C: JACK
D: Uh ... nah.
C: MARLA
D: Well... thanks, anyway.
E: pause
N: Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than just friendly. Jack pulls away.
C: JACK
D: So.... are we done?
N: Marla sighs.
C: MARLA
D: Yeah, we're done. See you around.
S: EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack emerges from the lobby. He looks up at Marla's window, watches her silhouette. He walks away, right into -- Big BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.
C: BOB
D: Cornelius! How are you?
C: JACK
D: Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
C: BOB
D: Better than I've ever been in my life.
C: JACK
D: Really? Great. Still "Remaining Men Together?"
N: An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.
C: BOB
D: No. I found something new.
C: JACK
D: Really, what's that?
C: BOB
D: The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
E: quietly
C: JACK
D: Oh.
C: BOB
D: And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
C: JACK
D: Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
C: BOB
D: You are?!
C: JACK
D: Look at my face.
N: Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.
C: BOB
D: That's a fucking great, man! Fucking great! Congratulations.
C: JACK
D: Yeah, both of us.
C: BOB
D: You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution. They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden?
S: INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the circle of light. Bob's eyes are wild with glee.
S: EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER
N: Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none of these guys before - it's a new chapter. Jack and Bob Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape. They both grin with religious serenity. Bob hugs Jack.
C: BOB
D: Thank you. Thank you.
N: Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.
C: JACK
D: You're welcome.
C: JACK
D: Fight club -- this was mine and Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.
E: V.O.
S: INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
N: Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK. Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink. Jack takes out a cigarette, lights up. He offers the pack...
C: TYLER
D: No thanks, I quit.
C: JACK
D: You quit?
C: TYLER
D: Yeah. Where you headed?
C: JACK
D: Work. Going to work.
N: Tyler scratches his chin absently.
C: JACK
D: What... ?
C: TYLER
D: Nothing. Do what you like.
N: Tyler walks out the way he came.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.
S: INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe. Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.
C: JACK
D: We need to talk.
C: BOSS
D: Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review...
C: JACK
D: I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
N: Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.
C: JACK
D: Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
C: BOSS
D: Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You're fired!
C: JACK
D: What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home.
N: Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.
C: BOSS
D: You little fucker! I oughta...
N: Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose. Blood starts to trickle. He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and SHATTERS the glass. He falls to the floor.
C: JACK
D: I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.
E: V.O.
N: Jack gets back to his feet.
C: JACK
D: Please... don't hit me again, please. I'm your responsibility...
N: He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again. He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents flying. He hits the floor.
C: JACK
D: For some reason, I thought of my first fight -- with Tyler.
E: V.O.
N: Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.
C: JACK
D: Please... give me the paychecks like I asked for. I won't be any trouble. You won't see me again.
N: Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off. Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.
C: JACK
D: Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted, something horrible had been growing.
E: V.O.
N: Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting himself up. He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.
C: JACK
D: Please... please...
C: JACK
D: And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
E: V.O.
N: Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight. Behind them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.
C: JACK
D: Please don't hit me again.
E: gurgling blood
S: INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

N: Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.
C: JACK
D: Forty-eight airline flight coupons. Plus... hold on... just a minute...
N: Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door. He drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

D: I am now officially self-employed.
N: Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.
C: TYLER
D: Good for you.
S: INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: LOUD. An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob, stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle, holding up his hands to quiet them...
C: TYLER
D: I look around... I look around and see a lot of new faces.
N: An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.
C: TYLER
D: Shut up! Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club.
N: A glum silence falls. Guys look at each other.
C: TYLER
D: I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived -- an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars.
E: more
N: TYLER (cont) Advertisements have them chasing cars and clothes, working jobs they hate so they can buy shit they don't need. We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, or great depression. The great war is a spiritual war. The great depression is our lives. We were raised by television to believe that we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars -- but we won't. And we're learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed-off. The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement. Jack looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.
C: TYLER
D: We are the quiet young men who listen until it's time to decide.
N: A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.
C: TYLER
D: Who are you?
C: FAT MAN
D: Who am I?! There's a sign on the front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?!
E: LOU
C: TYLER
D: Tyler Durden.
N: Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.
C: LOU
D: Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
C: TYLER
D: We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
C: LOU
D: Irvine? Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
N: Everyone glances guiltily at each other.
C: LOU
D: He don't own this place, I do. How much money's he getting for this?
C: TYLER
D: There is no money.
C: LOU
D: Really?
C: TYLER
D: It's free to all.
C: LOU
D: Ain't that something?
C: TYLER
D: Yes, it is.
C: LOU
D: Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
C: TYLER
D: You're welcome to join our club.
C: LOU
D: Did you hear what I just said?!
C: TYLER
D: You and your friend.
N: Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.
C: LOU
D: You hear me now?
N: Tyler gains his breath, determined. He looks up, turns his head, looking to Jack. Jack watches, wide-eyed. Tyler straightens, facing Lou.
C: TYLER
D: No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
N: Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face. Some of the guys move forward, but the Thug points his gun. Jack-runs forward anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face. More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.
C: TYLER
D: We really need to use this place.
N: Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his face, his stomach. Tyler collapses to the floor. Lou starts KICKING his. Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.
C: TYLER
D: That's it.... that's good. Get it all out. You'll feel better.
N: Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more. Finally, sweating, bewildered, Lou stops. He looks to the Thug, who is just as bewildered. Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...
C: TYLER
D: Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world...
N: Tyler's blood spatters on Lou. Lou tries to shake Tyler off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE. The Thug grabs Tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou. Lou slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood. Tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth...
C: TYLER
D: You don't know where I've been.
N: Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor. Tyler rubs his bloody face into Lou's face. The Thug lifts Tyler. Tyler clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...
C: TYLER
D: We need this place. We need it. Please let us keep it, please...
N: Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.
C: LOU
D: What are you doing?!
C: TYLER
D: Pleeeeeease!
C: LOU
D: Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
C: TYLER
D: We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
C: LOU
D: Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
C: TYLER
D: Thank you. Thank you, sir...
C: LOU
D: Let go of me!!
N: Tyler lets go of Lou's belt. Lou scrambles away. The Thug drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood. Lou gets to his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys. He and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind. Fight club surrounds Tyler. They help him up, move him to a crate. Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.
C: TYLER
D: This week, each of you has a homework assignment. You're going to go out and start a fight with a total stranger... You're going to start a fight... and you're going to lose.
E: pause, drooling blood
N: Jack beams in appreciation.

C: YUPPIE
D: Hey! Wha... What the hell... what are you doing?! Who are you?!!
N: The Yuppie backs away. Ricky follows...
C: YUPPIE
D: Get away from me! Keep away! NO... !
N: Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie. The Yuppie struggles spastically.
C: YUPPIE
D: Who are you!? Why are you attacking me... ?!
N: Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.
S: EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY
N: A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the sidewalk. As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.
C: FIRST MAN
D: Hey... hey...
C: SECOND MAN
D: Watch out, jackass!
N: These men continue on their way. The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who looks down, stunned.
C: SEMINARIAN
D: You... you did that on purpose!
N: The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian. The Seminarian grabs the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it. The Mechanic shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH. The Mechanic purposely takes it. The Seminarian starts to run away. The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the Seminarian in the back of the neck. They fight.
S: INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

D: There's fight club in Delaware City.
C: TYLER
D: I heard. Local 15, Monday nights.
N: As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...
C: JACK

N: Huge office. Rows and rows of desks. FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each. Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE, filling each monitor with gasoline.
S: INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE
N: Files and newspaper clippings are piled up. HANDS write on a new FILE FOLDER: "Arson."
S: EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY
N: The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket, stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX. Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS... HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.
S: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
N: Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the convenience store. Jack wears a BACKPACK.
C: TYLER
D: Let me have that a minute...
N: Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.
C: JACK
D: What are we doing?
C: TYLER
D: Homework assignment.
C: JACK
D: What is it?
N: Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.
C: TYLER
D: Human Sacrifice.
N: Jack turns white, staring at the gun.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out at gunpoint, forces him to his knees. Jack follows, freaked. Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.
C: JACK
D: On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
E: V.O.
C: CLERK
D: Please... don't...
C: TYLER
D: Give me your wallet.
N: The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler snatches it. Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.
C: TYLER
D: Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.
C: RAYMOND
D: How'd you know?
C: TYLER
D: They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.
N: Tyler rummages through the wallet.
C: TYLER
D: Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
C: RAYMOND
D: Yesssss...
C: TYLER
D: Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
C: RAYMOND
D: Please, God, no...
N: Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.
C: JACK
D: Tyler...
C: TYLER
D: An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
C: RAYMOND
D: S-S-Stuff.
C: TYLER
D: "Stuff." Were the mid-terms hard?
N: Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.
C: TYLER
D: I asked you what you studied.
C: JACK
D: Tell him!
C: RAYMOND
D: Biology, mostly.
C: TYLER
D: Why?
C: RAYMOND
D: I... I don't know...
C: TYLER
D: What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
N: Raymond weeps and says nothing. Tyler COCKS the gun. Raymond GASPS.
C: TYLER
D: The question, Raymond, was "what did you want to be?"
N: A beat.
C: JACK
D: Answer him!
C: RAYMOND
D: A veterinarian!
C: TYLER
D: Animals.
C: RAYMOND
D: Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
C: TYLER
D: Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
C: RAYMOND
D: Too much school.
N: Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.
C: TYLER
D: Would you rather be dead?
C: RAYMOND
D: No, please, no, God, no!
N: Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.
C: RAYMOND
D: NOOOOO!
N: Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.
C: TYLER
D: I'm keeping your license. I know where you live. I'm going to check on you. If you aren't back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead. Get the hell out of here.
N: Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway. Jack and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.
C: JACK
D: I feel sick.
C: TYLER
D: Imagine how he feels.
N: Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger -- CLICK. Empty.
C: JACK
D: I don't care, that was horrible.
N: Tyler walks away.
C: TYLER
D: Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.
N: Jack watches Tyler go.
C: TYLER
D: His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten.
N: Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran. He finally turns back, following after Tyler.
S: INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT
N: SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !
S: EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING
N: Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.
S: EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN
N: VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it across rocks and dirt. He stops a moment, rake on his shoulder, staring off. Then, back to work...
C: TYLER
D: ... You are not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the shoes you wear.
E: muttering quietly
N: Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...
C: TYLER
D: You are not the contents of your wallet...
S: INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT
N: The DRIVER has a broken nose. The bus is empty, except for Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.
C: JACK
D: He had a plan. Maybe you just didn't see it till it hit you between the eyes. But, it started to make sense... in a Tyler sort of way. No fear. No distractions. The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
E: V.O. pause
S: EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT
N: Jack gets off the bus. As the bus pulls away, we see it dropped Jack off right in front of the house.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack enters. Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.
C: JACK
D: Hey.
C: TYLER
D: Hey.
N: Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table. Tyler comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.
C: TYLER
D: Go on in. We're celebrating.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers. Tyler does NOT follow. BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.
C: RICKY
D: You are not your job.
C: OTHERS TOGETHER
D: You are not your job.
C: RICKY
D: You are not how much money you have in the bank.
C: BOB
D: Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...
N: Bob goes to turn up the TV. One guy, sixteen years old with an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.
C: ANGEL FACE
D: Great, thanks.
E: to Jack
N: Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.
C: BOB
D: Shhhhh! Watch!
N: Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER MORRIS BUILDING." The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.
C: REPORTER
D: Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived... just a second... excuse me, Commissioner, could you tell us what you think has happened?
E: V.O.
N: COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.
C: COMMISSIONER JACOBS
D: We believe this is related to the recent acts of vandalism around the city. It's some kind of organized group, and we are coordinating a rigorous investigation.
E: V.O.
N: Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him. Tyler tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.
C: JACK
D: What did you guys do?
N: They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER. They look at Jack and shake their heads. Jack doesn't get it. Suddenly, the guys' faces turn to stone. Bob sits rigid.
C: BOB
D: The first rule of Project Mayhem is... you do not ask questions.
N: Jack stares at them.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: A luxurious BANQUET. Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne. He rises and starts out of the room. Jack, in a WAITER'S UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB... RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Jacobs saunters down an empty hall. He stops to check his tie in a mirror. He pushes open the door of the MEN'S BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the bathroom. He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth. The OTHER "WAITERS" rush in. Jack stays back to keep the door shut. Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his pants. Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.
C: TYLER
D: Wrap it around the top of his hackie- sack.
C: BOB
D: Man, his balls are ice cold.
N: Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles. Jacobs is bug-eyed. Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.
C: TYLER
D: You're not going to continue your "rigorous investigation." You will publicly state that there is no underground group. Or -- imagine, the rest of your life with your scrotum flapping empty.
C: JACOBS
D: ... no... please, no...
E: mouth taped
C: TYLER
D: We'll send one to the New York Times and one to the Los Angeles Times. Press release style. Your nuts will be bicoastal. Understood? The people you're after are everyone you depend on.
E: more
N: TYLER (cont) We do your laundry, cook your food and serve you dinner. We guard you while you sleep. We drive your ambulances. Do not fuck with us. Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.
S: EXT. HOTEL - LATER
N: Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE ENTRANCE. Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back. Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning. Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.
S: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Fight club in full swing. Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.
C: JACK
D: I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.
E: V.O.
N: The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an inscrutable stone face. Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard. Blood flies. The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.
C: JACK
D: I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see.
E: V.O.
N: Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious. Jack stops, stares down, numb. Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to let him pass. Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.
C: TYLER
D: Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
C: JACK
D: I felt like destroying something beautiful.
S: EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER
N: RAINING. Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight. A idling car HONKS. Tyler leads Jack toward it. A bruised- faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.
C: VALET
D: There you are, Mr. Durden. Airport parking, long term.
C: JACK
D: After you, Mr. Durden...
E: motions to car
C: TYLER
D: No... after you.
S: INT. STOLEN CAR
N: Tyler gets in the driver's seat. Jack gets into the front passenger seat. Ricky and the mechanic are in back.
S: EXT. STREET
N: Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb. It has two bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."
S: INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER
N: RAIN GUSHES down. Jack stews, silent. The car moves down a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.
C: TYLER
D: Something on your mind?
C: JACK
D: No.
N: Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.
C: JACK
D: Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
C: TYLER
D: What should I have told you?
C: JACK
D: Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
C: TYLER
D: Fight club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
C: RICKY AND MECHANIC
D: The first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
E: together
C: JACK
D: This is as much mine as yours.
C: TYLER
D: Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
C: JACK
D: You know what I mean.
C: TYLER
D: What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
C: JACK
D: Look...
C: TYLER
D: Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?"
C: JACK
D: I want to know --
C: TYLER
D: What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
C: RICKY AND MECHANIC
D: The first rule of Project Mayhem --
E: together
C: JACK
D: Shut up!! I want to know what's going on.
E: to Ricky and Mechanic to Tyler
N: Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates... Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...
C: TYLER
D: This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.
C: JACK
D: What are you doing?!
C: TYLER
D: We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap...
C: JACK
D: Tyler...
N: Tyler steers back into the proper lane. The other CAR flies past, HORN SOUNDING...
C: JACK
D: What the hell ... ?!
C: TYLER
D: You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
C: JACK
D: I'm not asking you to.
C: TYLER
D: You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
C: JACK
D: I don't think that's true.
N: Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up. Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.
C: JACK
D: Tyler... what is this... !
N: Jack fights to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.
C: TYLER
D: What will you wish you'd done before you died?
C: RICKY
D: Paint a self-portrait.
C: MECHANIC
D: Build a house.
C: TYLER
D: And you?
E: to Jack
C: JACK
D: I don't know! Nothing!
C: TYLER
D: If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
C: JACK
D: I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
N: The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS. It moves to the other side of the road. Tyler steers there, too.
C: TYLER
D: I want to hear the truth.
C: JACK
D: Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that?
C: TYLER
D: Why do you think I blew up your condo?
C: JACK
D: What?
C: TYLER
D: Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
N: Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel... the car swerves... The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING. Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air. Jack looks at Tyler with dead eyes.
C: JACK
D: Okay, okay... fine...
N: Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air. Tyler studies Jack face, impressed. Tyler makes no move to take the wheel. THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder... heading for the stalled car. Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares. Tyler smiles. They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE! The back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass- over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...
C: JACK
D: I'd never been in a car accident. This must've been what all those statistics felt like before I filed them into my reports.
E: V.O.
N: The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.
S: EXT. OVERTURNED CAR
N: Tyler crawls from the passenger side. He walks around... opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the mud. Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear window. Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.
C: TYLER
D: We just had a near-life experience.
S: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
N: Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the ceiling. Tyler sits in a nearby chair.
C: TYLER
D: In the world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life. You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway.
N: Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.
C: TYLER
D: Feel better, champ.
E: leaving
S: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack sits at the table, sips coffee. He's pale, dazed, seems broken. He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from. Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter. Her back is to Jack as he looks at her. She pours ccffee and lights a cigarette. A beat of silence, then:
C: MARLA
D: I'll be out of your way in a sec.
N: She seems to be as weak as Jack.
C: JACK
D: You... don't have to... leave.
C: MARLA
D: Whatever.
C: JACK
D: Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
E: pause
C: MARLA
D: Chloe's dead.
C: JACK
D: When?
C: MARLA
D: Do you care?
C: JACK
D: I don't know.
C: MARLA
D: It was the smart move on her part.
N: Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face. There's a BRUISE on her ARM. Jack gets up, moves closer.
C: JACK
D: Why are we both... caught up like this... with... ?
C: JACK
D: I came so close to saying Tyler's name, I could feel it vibrate inside my mouth.
E: V.O.
N: Marla looks a him, waiting.
C: JACK
D: I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
C: MARLA
D: What do you get out of it?
N: Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING. Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from.
C: JACK
D: You hear that?
C: MARLA
D: Hear what?
C: JACK
D: That... sawing and hammering.
C: MARLA
D: Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject?
N: Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door, Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.
C: TYLER
D: You're not talking about me, are you?
E: harsh whisper
N: Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.
C: JACK
D: No.
E: to Marla and Tyler
C: MARLA
D: That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
C: TYLER
D: What are you talking about?
E: still a whisper
C: JACK
D: Nothing.
E: to Marla and Tyler
C: MARLA
D: Nothing? I don't think so.
C: TYLER
D: This conversation...
E: whisper
C: JACK
D: This conversation...
C: TYLER
D: ... is over.
C: JACK
D: ... is over.
N: Marla comes to touch Jack's hair. Jack closes the basement door. Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his hand. Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.
C: MARLA
D: What is this? Who did this?
C: JACK
D: ... A person.
C: MARLA
D: Guy or girl?
C: JACK
D: Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
C: MARLA
D: Why would you get bent if I asked?
C: JACK
D: Let go of me... Leave me alone.
E: pulls his hand free
C: MARLA
D: You're afraid to say.
N: Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with frustration. She leaves out the back door, not looking back. Jack leans against the wall. After a moment, he opens the basement door, heads downstairs...
S: INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE
N: Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...
S: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack looks around. TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the basement, as many as can fit into the space.
C: JACK
D: Tyler... ? What's this for?
E: calling upstairs
N: From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack opens the door. Ricky stands on the porch, staring ahead in subordinate military style. He's in black pants, black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.
C: JACK
D: Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?
N: Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.
C: TYLER
D: You're too young. Sorry.
C: JACK
D: Wait a minute...
N: Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.
C: JACK
D: "Too young?"
C: TYLER
D: If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
C: JACK
D: "Applicant?"
C: TYLER
D: If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
C: JACK
D: "Training?" Tyler...
S: EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets, unsure. Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.
C: JACK
D: Uh, look. You're too... young to... train here. You should probably be on you way.
N: No response from Ricky, who remains at attention. Jack goes back inside. Tyler closes the door.
S: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
N: Ricky remains at attention. Jack bursts out with a BROOM, knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.
C: JACK
D: Are you deaf?! I told you to leave! You will never get inside this house!
S: EXT. PORCH - MORNING
N: Ricky's still there. Tyler comes out, friendly.
C: TYLER
D: Look, friend, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. It's not the end of the world. Just go away. You're trespassing and I will call the police. Nothing personal.
S: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
N: Ricky, same spot. Jack bursts outside with the broom again.
C: JACK
D: You're never getting through this door, you stupid little weasel! Look at me when I talk to you... !
N: He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.
C: JACK
D: What is your major malfunction!?
S: INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the PORCH below.
C: JACK
D: Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PORCH - MORNING
N: Ricky's there. Bob is now next to him, in black, with a paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet. Tyler steps out. Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob. To all the following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --
C: TYLER
D: You have two black shirts? Two pair black trousers? One pair black boots? Two pair black socks? One black coat? Three hundred dollars personal burial money? Go inside.
N: Ricky goes in. Tyler turns to Bob.
C: TYLER
D: You're too old. Sorry. And, you're too fat. Nice seeing you.
N: Bob looks genuinely hurt. He picks up his mattress and starts away. Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes. Jack follows Bob...
C: JACK
D: Bob... Bob, wait... Let me explain this to you...
E: leading Bob back
S: EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
N: CRICKETS CHIRP. Bob stands at at rigid attention.
S: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
N: Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR. Tyler comes to give the top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.
C: TYLER
D: A monkey, ready to be shot into space. A Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.
N: From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."
S: EXT. PORCH - DAY
N: Jack looks out the window. Bob stands motionless. There's another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob. Ricky comes out the front door with the BROOM...
C: RICKY
D: You're too fucking old, fatty! We don't want your kind here! You're too short. Go away, stumpy! Go back to the circus!
E: to Bob to short guy
N: Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.
C: JACK
D: So it went...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
N: Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the square of backyard. They pull weeds, clear rocks; working with shovels, rakes, etc. They cart away WHEELBARROWS of rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.
C: JACK
D: Tyler built his army.
E: V.O.
N: IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...
S: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.
C: JACK
D: To what purpose, might one ask? Well, one might ask, if not for the first rule of Project Mayhem.
E: V.O.
N: Jack turns to look around the kitchen. THREE SPACE MONKEYS work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one SCRUBBING the walls. Jack walks out.
C: JACK
D: In Tyler We Trust.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY
N: Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.
C: JACK
D: And, then...
E: V.O.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY
N: Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...
C: JACK
D: Tyler...
N: The room is empty. Jack stares.
C: JACK
D: He was gone.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Jack enters. Space Monkeys render fat and make soap. They pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix. They add VODKA. Off to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE. On the wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."
C: FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
D: "You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We are all part of the same compost heap."
C: JACK
D: Planet Tyler.
E: V.O.
N: Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.
C: FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
D: "We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."
N: Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.
C: JACK
D: I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of Space Monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
E: V.O.
S: INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jack enters, vodka in hand. TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.
C: JACK
D: The house became a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing. So many people moving, the house moved.
E: V.O.
N: Jack walks out.
S: INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: Jack enters. Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart. Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS. Walls are lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson." Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through a file. Angel Face comes to take the file from him.
C: ANGEL FACE
D: That wouldn't interest you.
C: JACK
D: Where's Tyler?
C: ANGEL FACE
D: The first rule of Project --
C: JACK
D: Right, right.
N: As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE- BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.
S: EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT
N: Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes. In the BACKGROUND, a Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM. It's a ritual; no words. Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.
C: JACK

C: MARLA
D: Why are you doing this?
C: JACK
D: I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...

D: There are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area. Chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities. They're tightly-regimented, with many cells capable of operating without a central leader. Check this address: 1537 Paper Street. You'll find the body of Robert Paulson buried in the garden. You'll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin. The plan, I believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the TRW building.
C: STERN
D: Why these buildings?
C: JACK
D: You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank.
C: STERN
D: Keep him talking.
E: to other detectives
N: Stern leaves. A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile at Jack with REVERENCE.
C: FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
D: I really admire what you're doing. You're a brave man to order this.
C: JACK
D: What?
C: REDHEAD DETECTIVE
D: You're a genius, sir.
N: They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table. Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.
C: BALD DETECTIVE
D: You know the drill. You said if anyone ever tries to interfere with Project Mayhem, even you, we got to get his balls.
N: Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them aside. Jack SCREAMS. Flat-Top holds his legs.
C: FLAT-TOP
D: It's useless to fight.
C: REDHEAD
D: This is really a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden. It'll set quite an example.
C: JACK
D: No... you're making a mistake!
C: FLAT-TOP
D: You told us you'd say that.
C: JACK
D: I'm not Tyler Durden!
C: BALDY
D: You told us you'd say that, too.
C: JACK
D: Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm ordering you to abort the mission!
C: FLAT-TOP
D: You said you would definitely say that.
C: BALDY
D: What's our best time for a "cut and run?"
C: FLAT-TOP
D: Four minutes.
C: BALDY
D: Is somebody timing this?
C: REDHEAD
D: Wait till the second hand gets to the twelve.
E: looks at his watch
N: A KNOCK at the door. Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's mouth. He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy opens the door a crack. Stern mutters:
C: STERN
D: Some of this info checks out. Let's go to the place on Paper Street.
N: Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing the door. The two remaining Detectives continue. Jack kicks and screams and writhes. The Detectives wrangle him, but with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.
C: REDHEAD
D: Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up the time!
E: checking his watch
N: Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards -- Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls. Redhead lets go of one of Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting off the airway. Jack's face reddens... he's choking... Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN and points it at him. Redhead backs off. Jack gets up, gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises. Jack grabs one of the files off the table.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK DOOR. He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.
S: EXT. STREET
N: Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand, looking like a complete madman. Cars almost hit him.
S: EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER
N: Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."
S: EXT. 1888 LOBBY
N: Jack tries the door. Locked. He lifts a cast iron bench, runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass. The bench immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin! Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package. Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...
S: INT. 1888 LOBBY
N: Jack pushes through the broken glass. He sprints for the "PARKING" door...
S: INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING
N: Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS. He bolts to the STAIRS...
S: INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR
N: Jack enters, heaving. Again, NO CARS. He moves from one SUPPORT POST to another, searching. He finally spies, across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED. Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic. He walks around it. There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"... Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..
C: TYLER
D: Could be worse...
N: Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.
C: TYLER
D: You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
C: JACK
D: You... you can't be serious about this.
E: points at bomb
C: TYLER
D: What a ridiculous thing to say.
C: JACK
D: I can't let you...
C: TYLER
D: ...go through with this? What are you going to do?
C: JACK
D: I'm going to...
C: TYLER
D: ...stop me?
C: JACK
D: I'm not going...
C: TYLER
D: ...to let this happen!
C: JACK
D: Stop finishing...
C: TYLER
D: ...your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that.
N: Tyler gets up walks to Jack.
C: TYLER
D: What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body.
C: JACK
D: Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
C: TYLER
D: The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
C: JACK
D: You don't know that. There could still be people inside.
N: Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.
C: TYLER
D: Maybe. Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches. Good riddance.
N: Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his face. He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.
C: TYLER
D: I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order...
C: JACK
D: If you know, I know.
N: Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires.
C: TYLER
D: Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
N: Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.
C: JACK
D: If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
C: TYLER
D: This is not about martyrdom.
N: Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.
C: JACK
D: I'm pulling the green wire.
C: TYLER
D: Green? Did you say green?
N: Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned.
C: JACK
D: Yes...
C: TYLER
D: Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
C: JACK
D: Fuck you.
C: TYLER
D: I'm serious. That's the wrong one.
N: Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling. The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...
C: TYLER
D: Hear that? Marla's here. Just in the nick of time, eh?
N: Jack looks to Tyler. Tyler points towards the SOUND...
C: TYLER
D: See for yourself.
N: Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand, keeps an eye on Tyler. Jack looks over the railing... BELOW, a BUS idles. The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out, kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...
C: MARLA
D: You motherfuckers...
N: They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE. Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.
C: TYLER
D: I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla.
C: JACK
D: Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan?
N: Tyler thinks, shrugs.
C: TYLER
D: Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project "Mayhem."
C: JACK
D: Fuck your struggle. I want out.
C: TYLER
D: You want out?
C: JACK
D: I quit.
C: TYLER
D: Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let's get out of here.
E: looks at his watch
N: Tyler's walks away. Jack looks at the gun in his hand. He points the gun at Tyler...
C: JACK
D: Tyler...
C: TYLER
D: What?
E: still walking away
C: JACK
D: Defuse the bomb.
E: COCKS the gun
N: Tyler stops walking.
C: TYLER
D: Ask me nicely.
C: JACK
D: Defuse the bomb, please.
C: TYLER
D: Defuse the bomb?
C: JACK
D: Yes.
N: Tyler strides towards the BOMB. Jack trains the gun...
C: JACK
D: Please.
N: Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it. He grips the GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS. Jack lowers his gun.
C: TYLER
D: I did that for you. As a gesture. Now, how fast can you run? There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in the immediate area. If you're going to get them all, you better get cracking. Six minutes. Green wires, remember. I'll be upstairs.
E: looks at watch
N: Jack's stunned. Tyler walks across the parking garage, past Jack, heading for the STAIRS. Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES! Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding... Tyler spins to face Jack.
C: TYLER
D: Whoa! What was that all about?
N: Jack aims... FIRES! Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE. Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the post... Tyler is NOT THERE. Jack turns, takes slow steps, moving the gun from side to side... Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face. Jack falls. The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor... Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE. Jack looks to the gun, scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun... Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling. Jack rolls, holding his chest. He looks up, sees Tyler run into the STAIRWELL. Jack grabs the gun and follows...
S: INT. STAIRWELL
N: Jack smashes the door open. The stairwell's empty. Jack RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...
S: INT. MAIN LOBBY
N: Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM down onto his head. Jack drops to the floor. Tyler backs away, laughing. Jack gets to his feet, aims his gun...
C: TYLER
D: Fire at will.
N: Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler. Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect. Tyler raises his arms.
C: TYLER
D: What did you expect?
N: Jack charges. Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of Jack's hand. They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking each other to the floor...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned. ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor, alone, wrestling himself. He swings his left hand up, punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING himself in the side of the head...
S: INT. MAIN LOBBY
N: Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied. Tyler manages to get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's head against the floor... SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V. ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his own head against the floor, over and over...
S: INT. MAIN LOBBY
N: Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away. Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE. Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows... ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the lobby, disappears around a corner. Jack's right behind, turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE. Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head. He wheels. Tyler isn't there. A TAP on his shoulder. Jack turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face. Jack falls against the loft railing. Tyler comes forward, SWINGS... SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V. Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!
S: INT. MAIN LOBBY
N: Jack's dazed. Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward, SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS... Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head on the floor. Jack PASSES OUT...
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR
N: CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE. He looks around, trying to focus his eyes... JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from where his body was dragged across to where he is how. CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend. He turns his head -- TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S MOUTH. Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes... PULL BACK TO: Tyler is seated in Jack's lap. Tyler holds the gun in Jack's mouth, his arm around him. This huge room is being remodeled. Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY. Tyler looks at his watch.
C: TYLER
D: One minute.
C: JACK
D: I think this is about where we came in.
E: V.O.
C: TYLER
D: This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
E: looking out window
C: JACK
D: i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
N: Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.
C: JACK
D: I still can't think of anything.
E: still distorted
N: Tyler checks his watch.
C: TYLER
D: It's getting exciting now.
N: Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.
C: TYLER
D: Look what we've accomplished. Thirty seconds. Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse. One step closer to global equilibrium. I'm glad you're here with me.
E: checks watch looks out windows
N: Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.
C: JACK
D: Can't you call it off... ?
E: distorted
C: TYLER
D: It's out of our hands. This is it.
E: looks at watch
C: JACK
D: Please...
C: TYLER
D: Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10... 9... 8....
N: Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS, excited. Jack closes his eyes, despairing.
C: TYLER
D: 5... 4... 3... 2...
N: Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged. Nothing. A long beat. A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face. Jack opens his eyes. More waiting. Tyler looks genuinely surprised, pissed-off.
C: TYLER
D: What the fuck -- ?
C: JACK
D: Paraffin.
C: TYLER
D: What?
C: JACK
D: Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb.
E: relieved more
N: JACK (cont) They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best. Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts pacing. Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.
C: TYLER
D: Damn it! God-damn it...
C: JACK
D: Not exactly according to plan.
C: TYLER
D: Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
N: Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust. He reaches into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.
C: TYLER
D: ... Codename Rooster. Passcode First Strike...
E: into WALKIE TALKIE
N: Jack's eyes go wide.
C: JACK
D: NO...
C: TYLER
D: Proceed with remote detonation.
E: into WALKIE TALKIE
N: Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler. The GUN is knocked away. Jack STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off... Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it. Tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed. Jack stands.
C: TYLER
D: Haven't we already done this?
N: Jack SHOOTS TWICE. Bullets pass right thorough Tyler. Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.
C: JACK
D: How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
E: pointing
C: TYLER
D: Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
N: Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet. There's no walkie- talkie there. Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE CRUSHED under his own foot.
C: JACK
D: Oh... Christ...
N: Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.
C: JACK
D: Why... why... why... ?
C: TYLER
D: Why what?
C: JACK
D: Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
C: TYLER
D: You need me.
C: JACK
D: No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
E: pause
C: TYLER
D: Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings...
E: pause
C: JACK
D: Noooo, please...
N: Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.
C: TYLER
D: From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
C: JACK
D: ... no, no, no...
C: TYLER
D: No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
C: JACK
D: Why are you doing this?!
C: TYLER
D: I'm doing this for us.
C: JACK
D: Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
C: TYLER
D: If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
E: sullen
C: JACK
D: I swear on my life, I won't...
C: TYLER
D: You will. You know you will.
N: Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head. He looks at the gun in his hand...
C: TYLER
D: Can you live with that?
N: Jack stares at the gun a long time... then... Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH. Tyler cocks his head.
C: TYLER
D: What are you doing?
C: JACK
D: What have you left for me?
C: TYLER
D: Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
C: JACK
D: Not my mouth. Our mouth.
N: Tyler is calm.
C: TYLER
D: This is interesting.
N: Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands very close to Jack.
C: TYLER
D: Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
C: JACK
D: It's the only way to get rid of you...
N: Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.
C: TYLER
D: I can see you feel very strongly. I feel strongly too. Hey, you and me. Friends again?
E: pause pause
N: Their eyes are locked, unblinking. Long silence.
C: JACK
D: Do something for me.
C: TYLER
D: What?
C: JACK
D: Appreciate something.
C: TYLER
D: What?
C: JACK
D: Look at me...
C: TYLER
D: What?
C: JACK
D: My eyes are open.
N: EXTREME SLOW MOTION: Jack's finger squeezes the trigger... KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas. His eyes bulge. BLOOD flies out from his head. The WINDOW behind him SHATTERS. SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts. RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack... Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...
C: TYLER
D: What's that smell... ?
N: Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls... Tyler hits the ground. The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain. Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room, moving forward to Jack. TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.
C: TALL SPACE MONKEY
D: Are you all right, sir... ?!
N: Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole blown in his CHEEK. He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.
C: JACK
D: I'm okay...
N: Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to see. TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla. One holds a gun to Marla as she struggles.
C: SHORT SPACE MONKEY
D: Are you sure? You look terrible, sir! What's happened?
C: JACK
D: Everything's fine.
C: ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
D: Sir, you look really awful! Do you need medical assistance?
N: Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...
C: JACK
D: Bring the girl to me. The rest of you get out. Now!
N: The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.
C: MARLA
D: What happened... ?
C: JACK
D: Don't ask.
N: Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply. them to Jack's wound. Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.
C: JACK
D: Get to the rendezvous point. Move it!
N: Jack and Marla are left alone.
C: MARLA
D: My God, you're shot...
C: JACK
D: Yes.
N: Jack tries to got up. Marla helps him.
C: MARLA
D: Who did this to you?
C: JACK
D: I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
N: MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle... Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES; collapsing upon itself. Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES into a massive cloud of dust. Jack and Marla are silhouetted against the SKYLINE. Jack looks to Marla, reaches to take her hand.
C: JACK
D: I'm sorry... you met me at a very strange time in my life.
N: Marla looks at him. ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER... The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES. EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS. Then, the IMPLODING BUILDING again. SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...
T: FADE TO BLACK:
N: end
