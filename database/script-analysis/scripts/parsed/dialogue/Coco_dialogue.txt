MIGUEL=>Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born.
MIGUEL=>See, a long time ago there was this family.
MIGUEL=>The papá, he was a musician.
MIGUEL=>He and his family would sing, and dance, and count their blessings... But he also had a dream... to play for the world. And one day he left with his guitar... and never returned.
MIGUEL=>And the mamá...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! After banishing all music from her life...
MIGUEL=>She found a way to provide for her daughter... She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. She could have made candy!
MIGUEL=>Or fireworks!
MIGUEL=>Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!
MIGUEL=>But no... she chose shoes...
MIGUEL=>Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law.
MIGUEL=>Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business.
MIGUEL=>Music had torn her family apart, but shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great- great grandmother, Mamá Imelda.
MIGUEL=>She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on Día de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... And her little girl?
MIGUEL=>She's my great grandmother, Mamá Coco.
MIGUEL=>Holá, Mamá Coco.
MAMÁ COCO=>How are you, Julio?
MIGUEL=>Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything.
MIGUEL=>I used to run like this...
MIGUEL=>But now I run like this which is way faster!
MIGUEL=>And the winner is... Luchadora Coco!
MIGUEL=>I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple--
ABUELITA=>Miguel! Eat your food.
MIGUEL=>My Abuelita? She's Mamá Coco's daughter.
ABUELITA=>Aw, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.
MIGUEL=>No, gracias.
ABUELITA=>I asked if you would like more tamales.
MIGUEL=>S-sí?
ABUELITA=>That's what I THOUGHT you said.
MIGUEL=>Abuelita runs our house just like Mamá Imelda did.
ABUELITA=>No music!
ABUELITA=>No music!!
MUSICIANS=>AUNQUE LA VIDA--
ABUELITA=>NO MUSIC!!!
MIGUEL=>I think we're the only family in México who hates music...
MIGUEL=>And my family's fine with that...
MIGUEL=>But me?
MAMÁ=>Be back by lunch, mijo!
MIGUEL=>Love you, Mamá!
MIGUEL=>I am NOT like the rest of my family...
WOMAN=>Hola, Miguel!
MIGUEL=>Hola!
MIGUEL=>Muchas gracias!
STREET VENDOR=>De nada, Miguel!
MIGUEL=>Hey, hey! Dante!
MIGUEL=>Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump.
MIGUEL=>Good boy, Dante!
MIGUEL=>I know I'm not supposed to love music -- but it's not my fault! It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...
MIGUEL=>...The greatest musician of all time.
TOUR GUIDE=>And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history!
MIGUEL=>He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.
MIGUEL=>He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly!
MIGUEL=>And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It's--
REMEMBER ME=>THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
REMEMBER ME=>DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
DE LA CRUZ=>THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
REMEMBER ME=>EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE...
MIGUEL=>He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942...
DE LA CRUZ=>UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME!
MIGUEL=>When he was crushed by a giant bell.
MIGUEL=>I wanna be just like him.
MIGUEL=>Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too...
MIGUEL=>...If it wasn't for my family.
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Ay, ay, ay, muchacho.
MIGUEL=>Huh?
PLAZA MARIACHI=>I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story.
MIGUEL=>Oh, yeah, sorry.
MIGUEL=>I just can't really talk about any of this at home so...
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Look, if I were you I'd march right up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm a musician. Deal with it!"
MIGUEL=>I could never say that...
PLAZA MARIACHI=>You ARE a musician, no?
MIGUEL=>I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself--
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his sweet, sweet skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud!
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up for tonight. The music competition for Día de Muertos. You wanna be like your hero? You should sign up!
MIGUEL=>Uh-uh, my family would freak!
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Look, if you're too scared, then, well... have fun making shoes.
PLAZA MARIACHI=>C'mon. What did de la Cruz always say?
MIGUEL=>...Seize your moment?
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Show me what you got, muchacho. I'll be your first audience.
ABUELITA=>MIGUEL!
MIGUEL=>Abuelita!
ABUELITA=>What are you doing here?
MIGUEL=>Um...uh...
ABUELITA=>You leave my grandson alone!
PLAZA MARIACHI=>Doña, please -- I was just getting a shine!
ABUELITA=>I know your tricks, mariachi! What did he say to you?
MIGUEL=>He was just showing me his guitar...
TÍO BERTO=>Shame on you!
ABUELITA=>My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito -- he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him!
ABUELITA=>Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo?
ABUELITA=>You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now.
TÍO BERTO=>How many times have we told you -- that plaza is crawling with mariachis!
MIGUEL=>Yes, Tío Berto.
MIGUEL=>No, no, no!
ABUELITA=>Go away, you! Go!
MIGUEL=>It's just Dante...
ABUELITA=>Never name a street dog. They'll follow you forever. Now, go get my shoe.
ABUELITA=>I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
PAPÁ=>Miguel...
MAMÁ=>You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.
MIGUEL=>I was just shining shoes!
TÍO BERTO=>A musician's shoes!
MIGUEL=>But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
PAPÁ=>If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza.
MIGUEL=>But what about tonight?
PAPÁ FRANCO=>What's tonight?
MIGUEL=>Well they're having this talent show-
MIGUEL=>And I thought I might...
MAMÁ=>...Sign up?
MIGUEL=>Well, maybe?
PRIMA ROSA=>You have to have talent to be in a talent show.
PRIMO ABEL=>What are YOU going to do, shine shoes?
ABUELITA=>It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family.
ABUELITA=>Ofrenda room. Vámonos.
ABUELITA=>Don't give me that look. Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important! If we don't put them up, they can't come! We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where.
ABUELITA=>Where are you going?
MIGUEL=>I thought we were done...
ABUELITA=>Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like--
MIGUEL=>Like Mamá Coco's papá?
ABUELITA=>Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten.
MIGUEL=>But you're the one who--
ABUELITA=>Ta, ta, ta-tch!
MIGUEL=>I was just--
ABUELITA=>Tch-tch!
MIGUEL=>But--
ABUELITA=>Tch!
MIGUEL=>I--
ABUELITA=>Tch-tch!
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá?
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá is home...?
ABUELITA=>Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá is coming home?
ABUELITA=>No Mamá. It's okay, I'm here.
MAMÁ COCO=>Who are you?
ABUELITA=>Rest, Mamá.
ABUELITA=>I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel. Miguel... Miguel?
ABUELITA=>What are we going to do with that boy...?
ABUELITA=>You're right. That's just what he needs!
MIGUEL=>Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up.
MIGUEL=>You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me!
MIGUEL=>I wish someone wanted to hear me...
MIGUEL=>Other than you...
MIGUEL=>Perfecto!
A FEELING SO CLOSE=>YOU COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT I NEVER KNEW I COULD
WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH=>BUT IT'S TRUE...
NUN=>Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
ONLY A SONG ONLY A SONG=>HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE A HEART...
LOLA=>But my father, he will never give his permission.
INTERVIEWER=>Señor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment?
MIGUEL=>...and make it come true.
MIGUEL=>No more hiding, Dante. I gotta seize my moment!
MIGUEL=>I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me!
ABUELITA=>Día de los Muertos has begun!
MAMÁ=>No, no, no, no, no.
MAMÁ=>We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come, and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda, sí?
PAPÁ=>Mamá, where should we put this table?
ABUELITA=>In the courtyard, mijos.
PAPÁ=>You want it down by the kitchen?
ABUELITA=>Sí. Next to the other one.
MIGUEL=>Get under, get under!
ABUELITA=>Miguel!
MIGUEL=>Nothing!
MIGUEL=>Mamá -- Papá, I--
PAPÁ=>Miguel... Your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea! We've all decided -- it's time you joined us in the workshop!
MIGUEL=>What?!
PAPÁ=>No more shining shoes -- you will be making them! Every day after school!
ABUELITA=>Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on Día de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud!
ABUELITA=>You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria.
PAPÁ=>And wingtips, like your Papá Julio--
MIGUEL=>But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
PAPÁ=>Ah, Migue... You have your family here to guide you... You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...?
MIGUEL=>...A shoemaker. Through and through.
PAPÁ=>That's my boy! Berto, break out the good stuff, I wanna make a toast!
MIGUEL=>Dante! No, Dante, stop!
MIGUEL=>No, no, no, no, no! No...
MIGUEL=>De la Cruz's guitar...?
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá?
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá?
MIGUEL=>Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto de la Cruz?
MAMÁ COCO=>Papá! Papá!
MIGUEL=>Ha, ha!
MIGUEL=>Papá! Papá!
MIGUEL=>It's him! I know who my great- great grandfather was!
MAMÁ=>Miguel! Get down from there!
MIGUEL=>Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
PAPÁ=>What are you talking about?
MIGUEL=>I'm gonna be a musician!
ABUELITA=>What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family?
TÍO BERTO=>It's all that time he spends in the plaza...
TÍA GLORIA=>...Fills his head with crazy fantasies!
MIGUEL=>It's not a fantasy!
MIGUEL=>That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time!
PAPÁ=>We've never known anything about this man. But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family. This is no future for my son.
MIGUEL=>But Papá, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music!
ABUELITA=>Never! That man's music was a curse! I will not allow it!
MIGUEL=>If you would just let--
MAMÁ=>Miguel--
PAPÁ=>You will listen to your family. No more music.
MIGUEL=>Just listen to me play--
PAPÁ=>End of argument.
ABUELITA=>You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda?!
MIGUEL=>I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda!
MIGUEL=>No!
PAPÁ=>Mamá...
ABUELITA=>There. No guitar, no music.
ABUELITA=>Come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family.
MIGUEL=>I don't wanna be in this family!
PAPÁ=>Miguel! MIGUEL!
MIGUEL=>I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
STAGE MANAGER=>You got an instrument?
MIGUEL=>No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
STAGE MANAGER=>Musicians gotta bring their own instruments... You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list.
MIGUEL=>Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?
MIGUEL=>You guys have a spare guitar?
MIGUEL=>I need a guitar, just for a little bit--
MIGUEL=>Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do?
MIGUEL=>No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cállate! Shhh!
MIGUEL=>I'm sorry...
MIGUEL=>Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this.
MIGUEL=>Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment!
MIGUEL=>So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did!
VOICES=>The guitar! It's gone! Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar! The window's broken, look.
GROUNDSKEEPER=>Alright, who's in there?
MIGUEL=>I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my...
GROUNDSKEEPER=>There's nobody here!
MAMÁ=>Miguel!
MIGUEL=>Mamá!
PAPÁ=>Miguel! Come home!
PAPÁ=>Where are you, Miguel?!
WOMAN=>Dios mío! Little boy, are you okay?
WOMAN=>Here, let me help you.
MIGUEL=>Thanks, I--
SKELETON HEAD=>Do you mind?
MIGUEL=>Ahhh!
SKELETON HEAD=>Ahhh!
MIGUEL=>AHHH!
SKELETON ABUELA=>Look how big she's getting!
MIGUEL=>Dante?! You can see me? W-wait! What's going on?!
MIGUEL=>Dante! Dante!
MIGUEL=>I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
PAPÁ JULIO=>Miguel?!
TÍA ROSITA=>Miguel?
TÍA VICTORIA=>Miguel?
PAPÁ JULIO=>You're here! HERE here!
PAPÁ JULIO=>And you can see us?!
TÍA ROSITA=>Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!
MIGUEL=>Remind me how I know you?
TÍA ROSITA=>We're your family, mijo!
MIGUEL=>Tía... Rosita?
TÍA ROSITA=>Sí!
MIGUEL=>Papá Julio?
PAPÁ JULIO=>Hola.
MIGUEL=>Tía Victoria?
TÍA VICTORIA=>He doesn't seem entirely dead.
TÍA ROSITA=>He's not quite alive either...
PAPÁ JULIO=>We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know how to fix this!
TÍO FELIPE=>Oye!
TÍO OSCAR=>It's Mamá Imelda--
TÍO FELIPE=>--She couldn't cross over!
TÍO OSCAR=>She's stuck--
TÍO FELIPE=>--On the other side!
MIGUEL=>Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?
TÍO OSCAR=>Oh, hey Miguel.
TÍA VICTORIA=>I have a feeling this has something to do with you.
TÍA ROSITA=>But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us...
PAPÁ JULIO=>...Then we are going to her! Vámonos!
MIGUEL=>Whoa...
PAPÁ JULIO=>Come on, Miguel. It's ok.
MIGUEL=>Dante! Dante! Dante, wait up!
MIGUEL=>You gotta stay with me, boy. We don't know... where...
MIGUEL=>This isn't a dream, then. You're all really out there...
TÍA VICTORIA=>You thought we weren't?
MIGUEL=>Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins.
TÍA VICTORIA=>Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.
MIGUEL=>Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be...
SKELETON MOTHER=>Mija, it's not nice to stare at-- Ay! Santa Maria!
MIGUEL=>Are those...? Alebrijes! But those are--
TÍO OSCAR=>REAL alebrijes. Spirit creatures...
TÍA ROSITA=>They guide souls on their journey...
TÍO FELIPE=>Watch your step, they make caquitas everywhere.
CANNED LOOP=>Welcome back to the Land of the Dead. Please have all offerings ready for re-entry. We hope you enjoyed your holiday!
ARRIVALS AGENT=>Welcome back! Anything to declare?
TRAVELER=>Some churros... from my family.
ARRIVALS AGENT=>How wonderful! Next!
CANNED LOOP=>...If you are experiencing travel issues, agents at the Department of Family Reunions are available to assist you.
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Next family, please!
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Oh, your photos are on your son's ofrenda. Have a great visit!
ELDERLY COUPLE=>Gracias.
CANNED LOOP=>...And remember to return before sunrise. Enjoy your visit!
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Next!
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit!
JUAN ORTODONCIA=>Grashiash!
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Next!
HÉCTOR=>Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie...
DEPARTURES AGENT=>Well shoot. Looks like no one put up your photo, Frida...
HÉCTOR=>Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that.
DEPARTURES AGENT=>No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.
HÉCTOR=>You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone.
HÉCTOR=>Ha HA!
HÉCTOR=>Almost there, just a little further...!
OFFICER=>Upsy-daisy...
HÉCTOR=>Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge!
TÍA ROSITA=>I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.
ARRIVALS AGENT=>Next!
TÍA ROSITA=>Oh! Come mijo, it's our turn.
ARRIVALS AGENT=>Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare?
PAPÁ JULIO=>As a matter of fact, yes.
MIGUEL=>Hola.
VOICE OVER P.A.=>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta Gonzales-Ramos, please report to Level 7.
MIGUEL=>Whoa...
TÍO OSCAR=>I miss my nose...
DISTRESSED TRAVELER=>C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight...
MIFFED WIFE=>We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I demand to speak to the person in charge!
CASE WORKER=>I'm sorry, señora, it says here no one put up your photo--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies!
PAPÁ JULIO=>Mamá Imelda?
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.
PAPÁ JULIO=>Well, we never made it to the ofrenda...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>What?!
PAPÁ JULIO=>We ran into... um...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel?
MIGUEL=>Mamá Imelda...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>What is going on?
CLERK=>You the Rivera family?
CLERK=>Well, you're cursed.
MIGUEL=>What?!
CLERK=>Día de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead.
MIGUEL=>But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Guitar...?
MIGUEL=>It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that... ...musician! He is DEAD to this family!
MIGUEL=>Uh, you're all dead.
CLERK=>ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije is that?
MIGUEL=>That's just Dante.
TÍA ROSITA=>He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.
TÍO OSCAR=>He just looks like a plain old dog...
TÍO FELIPE=>...Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.
CLERK=>Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! -- terribly allergic.
MIGUEL=>But Dante doesn't have any hair.
CLERK=>And I don't have a nose, and yet here we are -- ACHOO!!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.
MIGUEL=>Oh...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
MIGUEL=>It was an accident!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>How do we send him back?!
CLERK=>Well, since it's a family matter... The way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing.
MIGUEL=>That's it?
CLERK=>Get your family's blessing, and everything SHOULD go back to normal. But you gotta do it by sunrise!
MIGUEL=>What happens at sunrise?
PAPÁ JULIO=>Híjole! Your hand!
PAPÁ JULIO=>Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you fainting on us.
CLERK=>But not to worry! Your family's here, you can get your blessing right now.
CLERK=>Cempasúchil, cempasúchil. Aha! Perdón, señora.
CLERK=>Now, you look at the living and say his name.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel.
CLERK=>Nailed it. Now say: I give you my blessing.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I give you my blessing.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I give you my blessing to go home...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>To put my photo back on the ofrenda...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>And to never play music again!
MIGUEL=>What? She can't do that!
CLERK=>Well technically she can add any conditions she wants.
MIGUEL=>Fine.
CLERK=>Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
MIGUEL=>No skeletons!
MIGUEL=>Mariachi Plaza, here I come--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Two seconds and you already break your promise!
MIGUEL=>This isn't fair, it's my life! You already had yours!
MIGUEL=>Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing.
MIGUEL=>Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tía Victoria?
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Don't make this hard, mijo. You go home my way, or no way.
MIGUEL=>You really hate music that much?
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I will not let you go down the same path he did.
MIGUEL=>The same path he did.
MIGUEL=>He's family...
TÍA VICTORIA=>Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
TÍO OSCAR=>She's just looking out for you.
TÍA ROSITA=>Be reasonable.
MIGUEL=>Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back!
CLERK=>Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?
MIGUEL=>Vámonos.
PATROLWOMAN=>We got a family looking for a LIVING BOY.
MIGUEL=>If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa.
PATROLMAN=>Hold it, muchacho.
PATROLMAN=>Ahh!
PATROLMAN=>I've found that living boy!
PATROLMAN=>Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me folks! Excuse me--
MIGUEL=>No, no -- Dante!
CORRECTIONS OFFICER=>...disturbing the peace, fleeing an officer, falsifying a unibrow...
HÉCTOR=>That's illegal?
CORRECTIONS OFFICER=>VERY illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo.
HÉCTOR=>Amigo? Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... I've just had a really hard Día de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now.
HÉCTOR=>And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while.
HÉCTOR=>Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show!
CORRECTIONS OFFICER=>Uh--
HÉCTOR=>I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! You just gotta let me cross that bridge!
CORRECTIONS OFFICER=>I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday... But my shift's almost up, and I wanna visit my living family... so I'm letting you off with a warning.
HÉCTOR=>Can I at least get my costume back?
CORRECTIONS OFFICER=>Uh, no.
HÉCTOR=>Some amigo...
MIGUEL=>Hey. Hey! You really know de la Cruz?
HÉCTOR=>Who wants to-- Ah! You're alive!
MIGUEL=>Shhh!
MIGUEL=>Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing.
HÉCTOR=>That's weirdly specific.
MIGUEL=>He's my great-great-grandfather.
HÉCTOR=>He's your wha-whaat...?
HÉCTOR=>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?!
MIGUEL=>D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g--
HÉCTOR=>No, niño, niño, niño, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel!
MIGUEL=>AH!
HÉCTOR=>I'm Héctor.
MIGUEL=>That's nice!
HÉCTOR=>Espérame chamaco!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Who has that petal Miguel touched?
PAPÁ JULIO=>Here!
PAPÁ JULIO=>Nice alebrije...
HÉCTOR=>Hey, hey, hold still. Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!
HÉCTOR=>Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos. Unless you're me.
MIGUEL=>You don't get to cross over.
HÉCTOR=>No one's ever put up my picture... But you can change that!
MIGUEL=>This is you?
HÉCTOR=>Muy guapo, eh?
MIGUEL=>So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home?
HÉCTOR=>Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible?
MIGUEL=>Mmm, nope.
HÉCTOR=>Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You gotta have SOME other family.
MIGUEL=>ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.
HÉCTOR=>Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...!
HÉCTOR=>...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. What are you doing?
MIGUEL=>I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.
HÉCTOR=>No, skeletons don't walk like that.
MIGUEL=>It's how you walk.
HÉCTOR=>No, I don't.
HÉCTOR=>Stop it!
MIGUEL=>Whoa..."Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!" Qué padre!
HÉCTOR=>Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Día de Muertos.
MIGUEL=>And you can get us in!
HÉCTOR=>Ahhhh--
MIGUEL=>Hey, you said you had front row tickets!
HÉCTOR=>That... that was a lie. I apologize for that.
HÉCTOR=>Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him.
MIGUEL=>How?
HÉCTOR=>'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing!
CECILIA=>You better have my dress, Héctor!
HÉCTOR=>Hola, Ceci!
MIGUEL=>Hola.
HÉCTOR=>Ceci, I lost the dress--
CECILIA=>Ya lo sabía! I gotta dress forty dancers by sunrise and thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number!
HÉCTOR=>Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci...
MIGUEL=>Dante... Dante!
MIGUEL=>We shouldn't be in here...
MIGUEL=>No, no, Dante! Ven acá!
FRIDA=>You! How did you get in here?
MIGUEL=>I just followed my--
FRIDA=>Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider of wandering spirits...! And whose spirit have you guided to me?
MIGUEL=>I don't think he's a spirit guide.
FRIDA=>Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this world can take many forms... They are as mysterious as they are powerful...
FRIDA=>Or maybe he's just a dog. Come! I need your eyes!
FRIDA=>You are the audience. Darkness. And from the darkness... A giant PAPAYA!
FRIDA=>Dancers emerge from the papaya and the dancers are all me!
FRIDA=>And they go to drink from the milk of their mother who is a cactus, but who is also me. And her milk is not milk but tears. Is it too obvious?
MIGUEL=>I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk...
MIGUEL=>Oh! And then it could go dittle- ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle- dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!
FRIDA=>And... what if everything was on fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!
FRIDA=>Inspired! You... you have the spirit of an artist!
FRIDA=>The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!
MIGUEL=>Huh?
FRIDA=>He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers--
MIGUEL=>Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?
FRIDA=>Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.
HÉCTOR=>Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities...
MIGUEL=>You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party.
HÉCTOR=>That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
MIGUEL=>If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?
HÉCTOR=>He's YOUR great-great grandpa. How come he didn't invite YOU?
HÉCTOR=>Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party?
GUSTAVO=>It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo...
MUSICIANS=>Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito!
HÉCTOR=>Ha ha, very funny guys. Very funny.
MIGUEL=>Chorizo?
GUSTAVO=>Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died!
HÉCTOR=>I don't want to talk about it.
GUSTAVO=>He choked on some CHORIZO!
HÉCTOR=>I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference!
HÉCTOR=>This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks!
MIGUEL=>Hey, I'm a musician.
HÉCTOR=>You are?
GUSTAVO=>Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party...
HÉCTOR=>No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think--
MIGUEL=>I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing.
MIGUEL=>You know where I can get a guitar?
HÉCTOR=>I know a guy...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy?
TÍA ROSITA=>A footprint!
PAPÁ JULIO=>It's a Rivera boot!
TÍO OSCAR=>Size seven...
TÍO FELIPE=>...and a half.
TÍA VICTORIA=>Pronated.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel.
HÉCTOR=>Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?
MIGUEL=>My great-great grandpa was a musician.
HÉCTOR=>...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, guácala, no...
MIGUEL=>Whadda you know?
MIGUEL=>So, how far is this guitar anyway?
HÉCTOR=>We're almost there...
HÉCTOR=>Keep up, chamaco, come on!
RATTY GROUP=>COUSIN HÉCTOR!!
HÉCTOR=>Eh! These guys!
RATTY MEMBER=>HÉCTOR!!
HÉCTOR=>Hey Tío! Qué onda!
MIGUEL=>These people are all your family?
HÉCTOR=>Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever.
TÍA CHELO=>Héctor!
HÉCTOR=>Tía Chelo! He-hey!
OLD TIAS=>Muchas gracias!
HÉCTOR=>Hey, hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharrón around?
TÍA CHELO=>In the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors...
HÉCTOR=>Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?
HÉCTOR=>Buenas noches, Chicharrón!
CHICHARRÓN=>I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor.
HÉCTOR=>C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I brought you a little offering!
CHICHARRÓN=>Get out of here...
HÉCTOR=>I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar.
CHICHARRÓN=>My guitar?!
HÉCTOR=>Yes?
CHICHARRÓN=>My prized, beloved guitar...?
HÉCTOR=>I promise we'll bring it right back.
CHICHARRÓN=>Like the time you promised to bring back my van?
HÉCTOR=>Uh...
CHICHARRÓN=>Or my mini-fridge?
HÉCTOR=>Ah, you see­-
CHICHARRÓN=>Or my good napkins? My lasso? My femur?!
HÉCTOR=>No, no, not like those times.
CHICHARRÓN=>Where's my femur?! You--
HÉCTOR=>Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?
CHICHARRÓN=>I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it. I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. You play me something.
HÉCTOR=>You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--
CHICHARRÓN=>You want it, you got to earn it...
HÉCTOR=>Only for you, amigo. Any requests?
CHICHARRÓN=>You know my favorite, Héctor.
WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA,=>HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR.
HER TEETH STICK OUT,=>AND HER CHIN GOES IN, AND HER...
HÉCTOR=>...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR.
CHICHARRÓN=>Those aren't the words!
HÉCTOR=>There are children present. HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!
CHICHARRÓN=>Brings back memories. Gracias...
MIGUEL=>Wait... what happened?
HÉCTOR=>He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the "Final Death."
MIGUEL=>Where did he go?
HÉCTOR=>No one knows.
MIGUEL=>But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back...
HÉCTOR=>No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories...
HÉCTOR=>Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.
HÉCTOR=>C'mon "de la Cruzcito." You've got a contest to win.
MIGUEL=>You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one.
HÉCTOR=>How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows.
MIGUEL=>No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time?
HÉCTOR=>Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much.
MIGUEL=>You don't know what you're talking about...
HÉCTOR=>Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! Showtime, chamaco!
VENDOR=>Llévelo! T-shirts! Bobble-heads!
EMCEE=>Bienvenidos a todos! Who's ready for some música?
EMCEE=>It's a battle of the bands, amigos! The winner gets to play for the maestro himself, Ernesto de la Cruz, at his fiesta tonight!
HÉCTOR=>That's our ticket, muchacho.
EMCEE=>Let the competition begin!
HÉCTOR=>So what's the plan? What are you gonna play?
MIGUEL=>Definitely "Remember Me."
HÉCTOR=>No, not that one. No.
MIGUEL=>C'mon, it's his most popular song!
HÉCTOR=>Ehck, it's too popular.
SKELETON MUSICIAN=>REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR, REMEMBER ME...
REMEMBER ME!=>DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY!
MIGUEL=>Um... what about "Poco Loco?"
HÉCTOR=>Epa! Now that's a song!
STAGEHAND=>De la Cruzcito? You're on standby! Los Chachalacos, you're up next!
CROWD=>LOS CHACHALACOS!
HÉCTOR=>You always this nervous before a performance?
MIGUEL=>I don't know -- I've never performed before.
HÉCTOR=>What?! You said you were a musician!
MIGUEL=>I am! I mean I will be. Once I win.
HÉCTOR=>That's your plan?! No, no, no, no, no, you have to win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?!
HÉCTOR=>I'll go up there--
MIGUEL=>No! I need to do this.
HÉCTOR=>Why?
MIGUEL=>If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician?
HÉCTOR=>What does that matter?!
MIGUEL=>'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it.
HÉCTOR=>Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time!
HÉCTOR=>Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM!
HÉCTOR=>First you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves! Sáquenlo sáquenlo, sáquenlo!
HÉCTOR=>Now gimme your best grito!
MIGUEL=>My best grito?
HÉCTOR=>Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you.
MIGUEL=>Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay...
HÉCTOR=>Oh, c'mon kid...
STAGEHAND=>De la Cruzcito, you're on now!
HÉCTOR=>Miguel, look at me.
STAGEHAND=>Come on, let's go!
HÉCTOR=>Hey! Hey, look at me.
HÉCTOR=>You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go!
EMCEE=>We have one more act, amigos!
MIGUEL=>Héctor...
HÉCTOR=>Make 'em listen, chamaco! You got this!
EMCEE=>Damas y caballeros! De la Cruzcito!
HÉCTOR=>Arre papá! Hey!
HÉCTOR=>What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?
AUDIENCE MEMBER=>Bring back the singing dogs!
MIGUEL=>HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!
MIGUEL=>WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU SAY PUT THEM ON YOUR HEAD AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
MIGUEL=>YOU MAKE ME UN POCO LOCO
UN POQUI-TI-TI-TO LOCO=>THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING I'M NODDING AND I'M YES-ING I'LL COUNT IT AS A BLESSING THAT I'M ONLY UN POCO LOCO...
HÉCTOR=>No, no, no, no...
MIGUEL=>Not bad for a dead guy!
HÉCTOR=>You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>He's close. Find him.
HÉCTOR=>THE LOCO THAT YOU MAKE ME IT IS JUST UN POCO CRAZY THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE NOT MAKING...
MIGUEL=>THE LIBERTIES YOU'RE TAKING...
HECTOR MIGUEL=>LEAVES MY CABEZA SHAKING LEAVES MY CABEZA SHAKING YOU ARE JUST UN POCO LOCO YOU ARE JUST UN POCO LOCO
TÍO FELIPE/TÍO OSCAR=>We're looking for a living kid... about 12?
TÍA ROSITA=>Have you seen a living boy?
HECTOR MIGUEL UN POQUI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI- UN POQUI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI-TI-=>TI-TI-TO LOCO!! TI-TI-TO LOCO!!
HÉCTOR=>Hey, you did good! I'm proud of you! Eso!
AUDIENCE=>Otra! Otra! Otra!
HÉCTOR=>Hey, where are you going?
MIGUEL=>We gotta get outta here.
HÉCTOR=>What, are you crazy? We're about to win this thing!
EMCEE=>Damas y caballeros, I have an emergency announcement. Please be on the lookout for a living boy, answers to the name of Miguel. Earlier tonight he ran away from his family. They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living...
EMCEE=>...If anyone has information, please contact the authorities.
HÉCTOR=>Wait, wait, wait! You said de la Cruz was your ONLY family. The ONLY person who could send you home.
MIGUEL=>I do have other family, but--
HÉCTOR=>You could have taken my photo back this whole time?!
MIGUEL=>--But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing!
HÉCTOR=>You lied to me!
MIGUEL=>Oh, you're one to talk!
HÉCTOR=>Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night! I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge 'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy!
MIGUEL=>It's not stupid.
HÉCTOR=>I'm taking you to your family.
MIGUEL=>Let go of me!
HÉCTOR=>You'll thank me later--
MIGUEL=>You don't wanna help me, you only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo!
HÉCTOR=>No -- no, no, no! No...
MIGUEL=>Stay away from me!
HÉCTOR=>Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?! Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!
MIGUEL=>Dante, cállate!
MIGUEL=>No, Dante! Stop it! He can't help me!
MIGUEL=>Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here!
CROWD MEMBERS=>It's him! / It's that living boy! / I heard about him. / Look! / He's alive! / The boy's alive.
MIGUEL=>AAHH!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home!
MIGUEL=>I don't want your blessing!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel! Stop!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Come back! Miguel!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I am trying to save your life!
MIGUEL=>You're ruining my life!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>What?
MIGUEL=>Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away! You'll never understand.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE...
MIGUEL=>I thought you hated music.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Oh, I loved it. I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice.
MIGUEL=>But I don't wanna... pick sides! Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. But you never will.
SECURITY GUARD=>Have a good time.
GUEST=>Oh, how exciting!
SECURITY GUARD=>Oh! El Santo! I'm a big fan.
SECURITY GUARD=>You mind if I--
SECURITY GUARD=>Gracias, señor!
SECURITY GUARD=>Invitation?
MIGUEL=>It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson!
MIGUEL=>Disculpen, señores...
BAND LEADER=>Hey guys, it's Poco Loco!
MIGUEL=>You too! Hey, musician to musician, I need a favor...
SECURITY GUARD=>Ooo, the competition winners! Congratulations chicos!
MIGUEL=>Thanks guys!
MIGUEL=>Whoa...
BAND LEADER=>Enjoy the party, little músico!
MIGUEL=>Gracias!
GUEST=>Look, it's Ernesto!
MIGUEL=>De la Cruz...
MIGUEL=>Señor de la Cruz!
MIGUEL=>Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
MIGUEL=>Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
NUN=>But what can we do? It is hopeless...
NUN=>Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
SEÑORAS Y SEÑORES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES SEÑORITAS Y SEÑORES=>TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT BRINGS ME JOY! ¡QUÉ ALEGRÍA! FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
MIGUEL=>FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
MIGUEL=>FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
DE LA CRUZ=>Are you all right, niño?
DE LA CRUZ=>It's you... you, you are that boy, the one who came from the Land of the Living.
MIGUEL=>You... know about me?
DE LA CRUZ=>You are all anyone has been talking about! Why have you come here?
MIGUEL=>I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson.
DE LA CRUZ=>I... have a great-great grandson?
MIGUEL=>I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you.
MIGUEL=>The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would?
DE LA CRUZ=>My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen?
DE LA CRUZ=>I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON!
CROWD=>Look, it's Frida!
HÉCTOR=>Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.
SECURITY GUARD=>It is an honor, señora!
HÉCTOR=>Gracias...
DE LA CRUZ=>Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson?
DE LA CRUZ=>My great-great grandson!
DE LA CRUZ=>He's alive! And a musician to boot!
MIGUEL=>Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.
DE LA CRUZ=>No dimple!
DON HIDALGO=>To our friendship!...
DE LA CRUZ=>You know, I did all my own stunts.
DE LA CRUZ=>All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living! They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!
DE LA CRUZ=>Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed...
MIGUEL=>No -- it's all great.
DE LA CRUZ=>But...?
MIGUEL=>It's just -- I've been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But... Did you ever regret it? Choosing music over... everything else.
DE LA CRUZ=>It was hard. Saying goodbye to my hometown. Heading off on my own...
MIGUEL=>Leaving your family?
DE LA CRUZ=>Sí. But I could not have done it differently. One cannot deny who one is meant to be. And you, my great-great grandson, are meant to be a musician!
DE LA CRUZ=>You and I, we are artists, Miguel! We cannot belong to one family. The world is our family!
DE LA CRUZ=>Ooo, the fireworks have begun!
DE LA CRUZ=>Soon, the party will move across town for my "Sunrise Spectacular!" Miguel, you must come to the show! You will be my guest of honor!
MIGUEL=>You mean it?!
DE LA CRUZ=>Of course, my boy!
MIGUEL=>I can't... I have to get home before sunrise.
DE LA CRUZ=>Oh, I really do need to get you home.
DE LA CRUZ=>It has been an honor. I am sorry to see you go, Miguel. I hope you die very soon. You know what I mean. Miguel. I give you my bles--
HÉCTOR=>We had a deal, chamaco!
DE LA CRUZ=>Who are you? What is the meaning of this?
DE LA CRUZ=>Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.
HÉCTOR=>You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel.
DE LA CRUZ=>You know this, uh... man?
MIGUEL=>I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you--
DE LA CRUZ=>Hé-- Héctor?
HÉCTOR=>Please Miguel, put my photo up.
DE LA CRUZ=>My friend... you're being forgotten...
HÉCTOR=>And whose fault is that?
DE LA CRUZ=>Héctor, please--
HÉCTOR=>Those were MY songs you took. MY songs that made YOU famous.
MIGUEL=>W-What?
HÉCTOR=>If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them--
MIGUEL=>That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs.
HÉCTOR=>You wanna tell him, or should I?
DE LA CRUZ=>Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
DE LA CRUZ=>We made a great team but -- you died and I -- I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive.
HÉCTOR=>Oh, how generous.
MIGUEL=>You really did play together...
HÉCTOR=>Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up--
DE LA CRUZ=>Héctor...
HÉCTOR=>--And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl.
HÉCTOR=>Ernesto... Remember the night I left?
DE LA CRUZ=>That was a long time ago.
HÉCTOR=>We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now.
MIGUEL=>Heaven and earth? Like in the movie?
HÉCTOR=>What?
MIGUEL=>That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, "El Camino A Casa."
HÉCTOR=>I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
MIGUEL=>No, it's in there. Look.
DON HIDALGO=>Never were truer words spoken. This calls for A TOAST! To our friendship! I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.
MIGUEL=>But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink...
DON HIDALGO=>Salud!
HÉCTOR=>That night, Ernesto. The night I left...
HÉCTOR=>We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick -- and I packed up my songs...
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ=>You wanna give up now? When we're this close to reaching our dream?
YOUNG HÉCTOR=>This was your dream. You'll manage.
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ=>I can't do this without your songs, Héctor--
YOUNG HÉCTOR=>I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ=>Oh, I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm... I'm sending you off with a toast!
HÉCTOR=>You walked me to the train station.
HÉCTOR=>But I felt a pain in my stomach. I thought it must have been something I ate...
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ=>Perhaps it was that chorizo my friend...
HÉCTOR=>Or something I... drank.
HÉCTOR=>I woke up dead.
HÉCTOR=>You... POISONED me.
DE LA CRUZ=>You're confusing movies with reality, Héctor.
HÉCTOR=>All this time I thought it was just bad luck.
HÉCTOR=>I never thought that you might have... that you...
HÉCTOR=>How could you?!
MIGUEL=>Héctor!
DE LA CRUZ=>Security! Security!
HÉCTOR=>You took everything away from me!
HÉCTOR=>You rat!
DE LA CRUZ=>Have him taken care of. He's not well.
HÉCTOR=>I just wanted to go back home! No, no, NO!
DE LA CRUZ=>I apologize. Where were we?
MIGUEL=>You were going to give me your blessing...
DE LA CRUZ=>Yes. Uh... sí.
DE LA CRUZ=>Miguel, my reputation, it is very important to me. I would hate to have you think...
MIGUEL=>That you murdered Héctor... for his songs?
DE LA CRUZ=>You don't think that. Do you?
MIGUEL=>I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy.
MIGUEL=>Papá Ernesto? My blessing?
DE LA CRUZ=>Security!
DE LA CRUZ=>Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay.
MIGUEL=>What?! But I'm your family!
DE LA CRUZ=>And Héctor was my best friend.
DE LA CRUZ=>Success doesn't come for free, Miguel. You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to... seize your moment. I know you understand.
MIGUEL=>No, NO!
MIGUEL=>Let go!
MIGUEL=>NO! AHHHHHH!
MIGUEL=>Help! Can anyone hear me? I wanna go home!
MIGUEL=>Héctor?
HÉCTOR=>Kid?
MIGUEL=>Oh, Héctor!
MIGUEL=>You were right. I should have gone back to my family--
HÉCTOR=>Hey -- hey, hey...
MIGUEL=>They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen--
HÉCTOR=>Hey, it's okay...
MIGUEL=>I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.
HÉCTOR=>Hey, chamaco, it's okay. It's okay.
MIGUEL=>I told them I didn't care.
HÉCTOR=>Hhuuh!
MIGUEL=>Héctor! Héctor--
HÉCTOR=>She's... forgetting me.
MIGUEL=>Who?
HÉCTOR=>My daughter...
MIGUEL=>She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge...
HÉCTOR=>I just wanted to see her again... I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco...
MIGUEL=>Coco?
HÉCTOR=>Where... where did you get this?
MIGUEL=>That's my Mamá Coco. That's my Mamá Imelda. Is that... you?
HÉCTOR=>We're...
HÉCTOR MIGUEL=>...family? ...family?
HÉCTOR=>I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world...
MIGUEL=>You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her...
HÉCTOR=>...Ever again.
HÉCTOR=>You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time.
REMEMBER ME=>THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
REMEMBER ME=>DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART REMEMBER ME
YOUNG COCO=>Papá!
HÉCTOR=>THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
REMEMBER ME=>EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
HÉCTOR YOUNG COCO=>KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME REMEMBER ME
MIGUEL=>He stole your guitar... He stole your songs...
MIGUEL=>You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!
HÉCTOR=>I didn't write "Remember Me" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa.
MIGUEL=>Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade!
MIGUEL=>My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family!
MIGUEL=>I'm proud to be his family! TRRRRRAI-HAY-HAY-HAY-HAAAY!
HÉCTOR TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY!=>I'm proud to be HIS family!
DANTE=>Rooo-rooo-roooooooo!
MIGUEL=>Dante?
DANTE=>Roooooo-roo-roo-rooo!
MIGUEL=>Dante! It's Dante!
HÉCTOR=>Imelda!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Héctor.
HÉCTOR=>You look good...
MIGUEL=>Dante, you knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide! Who's a good spirit guide? You are!
MIGUEL=>Whoa...
MIGUEL=>Dante!
PAPÁ JULIO=>Look, there they are!
FAMILY=>Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all right! / Oh thank goodness! / Gracias, Dios mío!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time!
MAMÁ IMELDA=>And you! How many times must I turn you away?
HÉCTOR=>Imelda--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death! I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
MIGUEL=>I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor. He was in there `cause of me. He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family.
MIGUEL=>I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Héctor's photo.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>What?
MIGUEL=>So he can see Coco again. Héctor should be on our ofrenda. He's part of our family--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>He left this family!
MIGUEL=>He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him!
HÉCTOR=>It's true, Imelda.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you?
HÉCTOR=>Imelda, I--
MIGUEL=>Héctor?
HÉCTOR=>I'm running out of time. It's Coco...
MAMÁ IMELDA=>She's forgetting you...
MIGUEL=>You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but--
HÉCTOR=>This is my fault, not yours. I'm sorry, Imelda.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home? No more music?
MIGUEL=>Family comes first.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>I -- I can't forgive you. But I will help you.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>So how do we get to de la Cruz?
MIGUEL=>I might know a way...
FRIDA=>Good luck, muchacho.
MIGUEL=>Gracias Frida!
MIGUEL=>Ow!
HÉCTOR=>Here, let me help you with--
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Don't touch me.
MIGUEL=>Everyone clear on the plan?
TÍA VICTORIA=>Find Héctor's photo.
PAPÁ JULIO=>Give it to Miguel.
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Send Miguel home.
HÉCTOR=>Got your petals?
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Now, we just have to find de la Cruz--
DE LA CRUZ=>Yes?
MAMÁ IMELDA=>Ah!
DE LA CRUZ=>Don't I know you?
