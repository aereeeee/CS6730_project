A PROLOGUE=>crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.
NARRATOR=>In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy- two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. 3y the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.' The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stilleto and in the empty black void we:

TONY=>Me jail? No way. We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three. MAN #l You been in a mental hospital, Tony?
TONY=>Yeah, in the boat coming over.
TONY=>Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?

He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing. He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

He's even got himself a pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die." And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence more pronounced.

The faces of those in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth. He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

`TO@=>problem... This is Marta. Sure, no CONTINUED
TONY=>Hello, Marta. She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

TOAD=>Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?

As he mutters something in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope. Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begin6 assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.
